<h2>I</h2>
<h3>ONE KIND OF WIRELESS</h3>
</div>

<p>When, after school that afternoon, Alex Ward
waved a good-by to his father, the Bixton
station agent for the Middle Western, and set off
up the track on the spring&#8217;s first fishing, he had
little thought of exciting experiences ahead of him.
Likewise, when two hours later a sudden heavy
shower found him in the woods three miles from home,
and with but three small fish, it was only with feelings
of disappointment that he wound up his line and ran
for the shelter of an old log-cabin a hundred yards
back from the stream.
</p>
<p>Scarcely had Alex reached the doorway of the
deserted house when he was startled by a chorus of
excited voices from the rear. He turned quickly to
a window, and with a cry sprang back out of sight.
Emerging from the woods, excitedly talking and gesticulating,
was a party of foreigners who had been
working on the track near Bixton, and in their midst,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span>
his hands bound behind him, was Hennessy, their
foreman.
</p>
<p>For a moment Alex stood rooted to the spot.
What did it mean? Suddenly realizing his own possible
danger, he caught up his rod and fish, and sprang
for the door.
</p>
<p>On the threshold he sharply halted. In the open he
would be seen at once, and pursued! He turned and
cast a quick glance round the room. The ladder to the
loft! He darted for it, scrambled up, and drew himself
through the opening just as the excited foreigners
poured in through the door below. For some moments
afraid to move, Alex lay on his back, listening to the
hubbub beneath him, and wondering in terror what the
trackmen intended doing with their prisoner. Then,
gathering courage at their continued ignorance of his
presence, he cautiously moved back to the opening and
peered down.
</p>
<p>The men were gathered in the center of the room,
all talking at once. But he could not see the foreman.
As he leaned farther forward heavy footfalls sounded
about the end of the house, and Big Tony, a huge
Italian who had recently been discharged from the
gang, appeared in the doorway.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We puta him in da barn,&#8221; he announced in broken
English; for the rest of the gang were Poles. &#8220;Tomaso,
he watcha him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; now listen,&#8221; continued the big trackman
fiercely, as the rest gathered about him. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t
tell everyt&#8217;ing. Besides disa man Hennessy he say
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span>
cuta da wage, an&#8217; send for odders take your job, he
tella da biga boss you no worka good, so da biga boss
he no pay you for all da last mont&#8217;!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The ignorantly credulous Poles uttered a shout of
rage. Several cried: &#8220;Keel him! Keel him!&#8221; Alex,
in the loft, drew back in terror.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No! Dere bettera way dan dat,&#8221; said Tony.
&#8220;Da men to taka your job come to-night on da Nomber
Twent&#8217;. I hava da plan.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You alla know da old track dat turn off alonga da
riv&#8217; to da old brick-yard? Well, hunerd yard from da
main line da old track she washed away. We will
turn da old switch, Nomber Twent&#8217; she run on da old
track&mdash;an&#8217; swoosh! Into da riv&#8217;!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Run No. 20 into the river! Alex almost cried aloud.
And he knew the plan would succeed&mdash;that, as Big
Tony said, a hundred yards from the main-line track
the old brick-yard siding embankment was washed out
so that the rails almost hung in the air.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dena we all say,&#8221; went on Big Tony, &#8220;we alla
say, Hennessy, he do it. We say we caughta him.
See?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Again Alex glanced down, and with hope he saw
that some of the Poles were hesitating. But Tony
quickly added: &#8220;An&#8217; no one else be kill buta da strike-break&#8217;.
No odder peoples on da Nomber Twent&#8217; disa
day at night. An&#8217; da trainmen dey alla have plent&#8217;
time to jomp.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Only da men wat steala your job,&#8221; he repeated
craftily. And with a sinking heart Alex saw that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span>
the rest of the easily excitable foreigners had been
won.
</p>
<p>Again he moved back out of sight. Something must
be done! If he could only reach the barn and free the
foreman!
</p>
<p>But of course the first thing to do was to make his
own escape from the house. He rose on his elbow and
glanced about.
</p>
<p>At the far end of the loft a glimmer of light through
a crack seemed to indicate a door. Cautiously Alex
rose to his knees, and began creeping forward to investigate.
When half way a loud creak of the boards
brought him to a halt with his heart in his mouth.
But the loud conversation below continued, and heartily
thanking the drumming rain on the roof overhead,
Alex moved on, and finally reached his goal.
</p>
<p>As he had hoped, it was a small door. Feeling cautiously
about, he found it to be secured by a hook.
When he sought to raise the catch, however, it resisted.
Evidently it had not been lifted for many
years, and had rusted to the staple. Carefully Alex
threw his weight upward against it. It still refused
to move. He pushed harder, and suddenly it gave
with a piercing screech.
</p>
<p>Instantly the talking below ceased, and Alex stood
rigid, scarcely breathing. Then a voice exclaimed,
&#8220;Up de stair!&#8221; quick footsteps crossed the floor
towards the ladder, and in a panic of fear Alex threw
himself bodily against the door, in a mad endeavor to
force it. But it still held, and with a thrill of despair
he dropped flat to the floor, and saw the foreigner&#8217;s
head come above the opening.
</p>
<div class='figcenter'>

<img src='images/illus-008.jpg' alt='' title='' /><br />
<p class='caption' style='text-align:center;'>
&#8220;NOW I AM GOING TO CUT YOUR CORDS,&#8221; ALEX WENT ON<br />
SOFTLY.
<br />
</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span></div>
<p>There, however, the man paused, and turned to
gaze about, listening. For a brief space, while only
the rain on the roof broke the silence, the foreigner
apparently looked directly at the boy on the floor, and
Alex&#8217;s heart seemed literally to stand still. But at
last, after what appeared an interminable time, the
man again turned, and withdrew, and with a sigh of
relief Alex heard him say to those below, &#8220;Only de
wind, dat&#8217;s all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Waiting until the buzz of conversation had been
fully resumed, Alex rose once more to his knees, and
began a cautious examination of the door. The cause
of its refusal to open was soon apparent. The old
hinges had given, allowing it to sag and catch against
a raised nail-head in the sill.
</p>
<p>Promptly Alex stood upright, grasped one of the
cross-pieces, carefully lifted, and in another moment
the door swung silently outward.
</p>
<p>With a glance Alex saw that the way was clear, and
quickly lowering himself by his hands, dropped. Here
the rain once more helped him. On the wet, soggy
ground he alighted with scarcely a sound. Momentarily,
however, though he now breathed easily for the
first time since he had entered the house, he stood, listening.
The excited talking inside went on uninterruptedly,
and moving to the corner, he peered about
in the direction of the barn.
</p>
<p>Leaning in the doorway, smoking, and most fortunately,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
with his back towards the house, was the
Italian, Tomaso. Beyond doubt the foreman was inside!
</p>
<p>At the rear of the barn, and some hundred feet from
where Alex stood, was a small cow-stable. Alex determined
to make an effort to reach it, and see if
from there he could not get, unseen, into the barn
itself.
</p>
<p>The Italian continued to smoke peacefully, and
with his eyes constantly on him Alex stepped forth,
and set off across the clearing on tiptoe. The guard
puffed on, and he neared the stable. Then suddenly
the man moved, and made as though to turn. But
with a bound Alex shot forward on the run, made the
remaining distance, and was out of view.
</p>
<p>The rear door of the stable was open. On tiptoe
Alex made his way inside. The door leading into the
barn also was ajar. With bated breath, pausing after
each step, Alex went forward, reached it, and peered
within.
</p>
<p>Yes, the foreman was there, a dim figure sitting on
the floor a few feet from him. But the outer doorway,
in which stood the man on guard, also was only a few
feet away, and at once Alex saw that the problem of
reaching the foreman without being discovered was
to be a difficult one. Trusting to the now gathering
gloom of the twilight, however, Alex determined to
make a try. Opening his knife and holding it in his
teeth, he sank to the floor, and began slowly worming
his way forward, flat on his stomach. It was a nerve-trying
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
ordeal. A dozen times he was sure the crackling
straw had betrayed him. But pluckily he kept
on, inch by inch, and finally was almost within touch
of the unsuspecting prisoner.
</p>
<p>Then very softly he hissed. Sharply, as he had
feared, the foreman twisted about. But at the moment,
by great good luck, the foreigner at the door
turned to knock his pipe against the door-post, and
hurriedly Alex whispered, &#8220;Don&#8217;t move, Mr. Hennessy!
It&#8217;s Alex Ward! I was in the old house, and
saw them bring you up.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And, Mr. Hennessy, they plan to run Twenty into
the river to-night. Tony told them there were strike-breakers
aboard her to take their places.&#8221;
</p>
<p>In spite of himself the foreman uttered a low exclamation.
At once the man in the door turned. But
with quick presence of mind the prisoner changed the
exclamation to a loud cough, and after a moment,
while Alex lay holding his breath, the Italian turned
his attention again to his pipe.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now I am going to cut your cords,&#8221; Alex went
on softly. &#8220;Be careful not to let your arms seem to
be free.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The foreman nodded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There,&#8221; announced Alex as the twine dropped
from the prisoner&#8217;s wrists.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, what shall we do? There is a door behind
you into the cow-stable&mdash;the one I came in by. Suppose
you work back towards it as far as you dare,
then make a dash for it?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; whispered the foreman over his shoulder.
&#8220;But you get out first.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; responded Alex, and immediately began
moving backwards, feet first, as he had come.
</p>
<p>Their escape was to be made more easy, however.
At the moment from the house came a call. The man
in the doorway stepped out to reply, and in an instant
seeing the opportunity both Alex and the foreman
were on their feet, and had darted out into the stable.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now for a sprint!&#8221; said the foreman.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Or, say, suppose I hide here in the stable,&#8221; suggested
Alex. &#8220;They don&#8217;t know of my being here.
Then as soon as the way is clear I can get off in the
opposite direction, and one of us would be sure to
get away.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good idea,&#8221; agreed the foreman. &#8220;All right,
you&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>There came a loud cry from the barn, and instantly
he was off, and Alex, darting back, crept low under
a stall-box. As he did so the Italian dashed by and
out, and uttered a second cry as he discovered the fleeing
foreman. From the house came an answer, then
a chorus of shouts that told the rest of the gang had
joined in the chase.
</p>
<p>Alex lay still until the last sound of pursuit had
died away, then slipped forth, glanced sharply about,
and dashed off for the woods in the direction of the
river and the railroad bridge.
</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>

<p class='caption' style='text-align:center;'>
HELD IT OVER THE BULL&#8217;S-EYE, ALTERNATELY COVERING AND<br />
UNCOVERING THE STREAM OF LIGHT.
<br />
</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span></div>
<p>The adventure was not yet over, however. Alex
had almost reached the shelter of the trees, and was
already congratulating himself on his safety, when
suddenly from the opposite side of the clearing rose
a shout of &#8220;De boy! De boy!&#8221; Glancing back in
alarm he saw several of the Poles cutting across in an
endeavor to head him off.
</p>
<p>Onward he dashed with redoubled speed. With a
final rush he reached the trees ahead of them, and
plunging into the friendly gloom, darted on recklessly,
diving between trunks, and over logs and bushes like
a young hare.
</p>
<p>A quarter of a mile Alex ran desperately, then
halted, panting, to listen. Not a sound save his own
breathing broke the stillness. Surely, thought Alex,
I haven&#8217;t shaken them off that easily, unless they
were already winded from their chase after&mdash;
</p>
<p>Off to the right rose a shrill whistle. From immediately
to the left came an answer. Then he understood.
They were heading him off from the railroad
and the river spur.
</p>
<p>Alex&#8217;s heart sank, and momentarily he stood, in
despair. Then suddenly he thought of the old brick-yard.
It lay less than a mile north, and was full of
good hiding-places! If he could reach it ahead of
them, what with the daylight now rapidly failing, he
would almost certainly be safe. At once he turned,
and was off with renewed vigor.
</p>
<p>And finally, utterly exhausted, but cheered through
not having heard a sound from his pursuers for the
last quarter mile, Alex stumbled into the clearing of
the abandoned brick-works, ran low for a distance
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
under cover of a long drying-frame, and scrambling
through the low doorway of an old tile oven, threw
himself upon the floor, done out, but confident that
at last he was safe.
</p>
<p>As he lay panting and listening, Alex turned his
thoughts again to the train. Had the foreman made
his escape? With so many promptly after him, it
seemed scarcely probable. Then the saving of Twenty
was still upon his own shoulders!
</p>
<p>And there was little time in which to do anything,
for she was due at 7:50, and it must be after 7 already!
</p>
<p>Could he not reach the switch itself, and throw it
back just before the train was due? That would be
surest. And in the rapidly growing darkness there
should be at least a fair chance of getting by any of
the foreigners who might be on the watch.
</p>
<p>Determinedly Alex gathered himself together, and
crawled back to the entrance. Near the doorway he
stumbled over something. &#8220;Oh, our old switch lantern!&#8221;
he exclaimed, holding it to the light, and momentarily
paused to examine it. For it had been placed
under cover there the previous fall by himself and
some other boys, after being used in a game of
&#8220;hold-up&#8221; on the brick-yard siding.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just as we left it,&#8221; said Alex to himself, and was
about to put it aside, when he paused with a start,
studied it sharply a moment, then uttered a cry, shook
it to see that it still contained oil, and scrambled hurriedly
forth, taking it with him.
</p>
<p>A moment he paused to listen, then set off on the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
run for the old yard semaphore, dimly discernible a
hundred yards distant. Reaching it, he caught the
lantern in his teeth, and ran up the ladder hand over
hand, clambered onto the little platform, and turned
toward the town.
</p>
<p>Yes! Through the trees the station lamps were
plainly visible! With a cry of delight Alex at once set
about carrying out his inspiration. Quickly trimming
the lantern wick, he lit it, with his handkerchief tied
it to the semaphore arm, and turned it so that the
bull&#8217;s-eye pointed toward the station.
</p>
<p>Then, catching off his cap, he held it over the bull&#8217;s-eye,
and alternately covering and uncovering the
stream of light, began flashing across the darkness
signals that corresponded with the telegraphic call of
the Bixton station.
</p>
<p>&#8220;BX,&#8221; he flashed. &#8220;BX, BX, BX!
</p>
<p>&#8220;BX, BX&mdash;AW (his private sign)! BX, BX,
AW!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The station lights streamed on.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Qk! Qk! BX, BX!&#8221; called Alex.
</p>
<p>His right hand tired, and he changed to the left.
&#8220;Surely they should be on the lookout for me, and see
it,&#8221; he told himself. &#8220;For when I go fishing I am
always home at&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>One of the station lights disappeared. Breathlessly
Alex repeated his call, and waited. Was it merely
some one pulling down a blind, or&mdash;
</p>
<p>The light appeared again, then disappeared, several
times in quick succession, and Alex uttered a joyful
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
&#8220;Hurrah!&#8221; and turning his whole attention to the
lamp, that the signals might be perfect, began flashing
across the night his thrilling message of warning:
</p>
<p>&#8220;THE FOREIGN TRACK HANDS&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>From a short distance down the spur came a shout.
Startled, Alex hesitated. Again came a cry, then the
sound of swiftly running feet.
</p>
<p>He had been discovered! In a panic Alex turned
and began to scramble down the ladder. But sharply
he pulled up. No! That would be playing the coward!
He must complete the message! And bravely
choking down his terror, he climbed back onto the
platform, and while the running feet and threatening
cries came nearer every moment, continued his message:
</p>
<p>&#8220;HANDS ARE&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop dat! Queek! I shoot! I shoot!&#8221; cried the
voice of Big Tony, immediately below him. Again
for a moment Alex quailed, then again went bravely
on, while the old semaphore rocked and swayed as the
enraged Italian threw himself at it and scrambled up
toward him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;GOING TO RUN&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>With a plunge the big trackman reached up and
caught him by the ankle, wrenched him back from the
lantern, and clambered up beside him. Catching the
light off the semaphore arm, he thrust it into the boy&#8217;s
face. &#8220;O ho!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;So it you, da station-man
boy, eh? An&#8217; you da one whata help Hennessy
get away, eh?
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span></p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; whata now you do wid dis?&#8221; he demanded
fiercely, indicating the lantern.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you can&#8217;t guess, I&#8217;m not going to tell you,&#8221; declared
Alex stoutly, though his heart was in his throat.
</p>
<p>&#8220;O ho! You wonta, eh? Alla right,&#8221; said Tony
softly through his teeth, and in a grim silence more
terrifying than the threat of his words, he blew the
lantern out, tossed it to the ground, and proceeding
to clamber down, grasped Alex by the leg and dragged
him down after.
</p>
<p>But help was at hand. As they reached the ground
a second tall figure loomed up suddenly out of the
darkness. &#8220;Who dat?&#8221; demanded Big Tony. The
answer was a rush, and a blow, and with a throttled
cry of terror the big track worker went to the ground
in a heap, the foreman on top of him.
</p>
<p>Alex uttered a cry of joy, then with quick wit, while
the two men engaged in a terrific struggle, he darted
in search of the lantern, found it, fortunately unbroken,
and in a trice was again running up the semaphore
ladder.
</p>
<p>As he once more reached his post on the platform
the big Italian succeeded in breaking from the foreman,
scrambled to his feet, and dashed off across the
brick-yard. &#8220;Come down, Alex. It&#8217;s all over,&#8221;
called Hennessy, gathering himself up. &#8220;And now
we&#8217;ve got to hike right off, a mile a minute, for the
main-line if we are to stop that train. They ran me
so far I only just got back. Unless Twenty&#8217;s late
we&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I am trying to stop her from up here,&#8221; interrupted
Alex, relighting the lantern.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Up there? What do you mean?&#8221; exclaimed the
foreman.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Signalling father at the station, with the telegraph
code,&#8221; said Alex as he replaced the lantern on the
semaphore arm. &#8220;Come on up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Al,&#8221; said the incredulous foreman as he reached
the platform, &#8220;can you really do it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I had it going when that Italian stopped me.
Watch.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But Alex was doomed again to interruption.
Scarcely had he begun once more flashing forth the
telegraph call of the station when from the direction
of the woods came a shout, several answers, then a
rush of feet.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Some of the Poles!&#8221; exclaimed the foreman.
&#8220;But you go ahead, Al, and I&#8217;ll see that they don&#8217;t
get up to interfere,&#8221; he added, determinedly.
</p>
<p>The running figures came dimly into view below.
&#8220;If any of you idiots come up here I&#8217;ll crack your
heads!&#8221; shouted Hennessy, warningly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got the station again,&#8221; announced Alex.
&#8220;Now it will take only a few minutes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>One of the men below reached the ladder, and, looking
up, shouted threateningly: &#8220;Stop dat! Stop dat,
or I shoot!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Go ahead, Al,&#8221; said the foreman, looking down.
&#8220;He hasn&#8217;t a gun.&#8221; But even as he spoke there was
a flash and a report, and a thud just over Alex&#8217;s head.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, stop! Stop!&#8221; cried the foreman. &#8220;Stop.
They&#8217;ve got us. No use being foolhardy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Leaning over, he addressed the men below. &#8220;Look
here,&#8221; he said, persuasively, &#8220;can&#8217;t you fellows see
that Big Tony is only using you to make trouble for
me, because I fired him for being drunk? As I told
you at first, everything he has said is untrue. Why
won&#8217;t you believe it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The men were silent a moment, then one of them
addressed Alex. &#8220;Boy, is dat true?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Every word of it,&#8221; said Alex, earnestly. &#8220;And
I would have heard all about it at the station if they
had intended cutting your wages, or bringing others
here to take your places.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Den I believe it,&#8221; said the Pole.
</p>
<p>The man with the pistol returned it to his pocket.
&#8220;I am sorry I shoot,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And now, what about the train?&#8221; inquired the
foreman, quickly. &#8220;Did you touch the switch?&#8221;
</p>
<p>In the look of guilt the foreigners turned on one
another he saw the alarming answer. Whipping out
his watch, he held it to the light.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Alex,&#8221; he said, sharply, &#8220;you have just ten
minutes to catch that train at the Junction! If
you don&#8217;t get her she&#8217;s gone! There&#8217;s not time
now to get down to the main line from here to flag
her!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Before he had ceased speaking Alex had his cap
over the light and was once more flashing an urgent
&#8220;BX! BX! BX!&#8221; while below the foreigners looked
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
on, now with an anxiety equal to that of the two on
the tower.
</p>
<p>&#8220;BX! Qk! Qk!&#8221; flashed the lantern.
</p>
<p>The station light disappeared. &#8220;Got &#8217;em!&#8221; cried
Alex.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just tell them first to stop Twenty at the Junction,&#8221;
said the foreman.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Right,&#8221; responded Alex, and while the rest
watched in profound silence, he signaled:
</p>
<p>&#8220;STOP NUMBER 20 AT JUNCTION. SPUR
SWITCH IS THROWN. GOT IT?&#8221;
</p>
<p>As Alex read off the promptly flashed &#8220;OK,&#8221; the
foreman sprang to his feet and gave vent to a joyful
hurrah of relief that echoed again in the clearing and
woods. Then, as Alex recovered the lantern, he
caught him under one arm, carried him down the ladder,
and there, despite his objections, hoisted him to
the shoulders of two of the now enthusiastic Poles,
and all set off jubilantly down the spur for the switch,
and home.
</p>
<p>And an hour later Alex&#8217;s father and mother,
anxiously awaiting him at the station, discovered
his approach carried at the head of a sort of
triumphal procession of the entire gang of trackmen.
</p>
<p>When Alex&#8217;s father the following morning reported
the occurrence to the chief despatcher, that official
called Alex to the wire to congratulate him personally.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That was a fine bit of work, my boy,&#8221; he clicked.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
&#8220;I see you are cut out for the right kind of railroader.
If fourteen wasn&#8217;t a bit too young I would give you
a job on the spot. But we will give you a start just
as soon as we can, you may be sure.&#8221;

<h2>II</h2>
<h3>AN ORIGINAL EMERGENCY BATTERY</h3>
</div>

<p>One afternoon two weeks later Alex returned
from school to find his father and mother hurriedly
packing his suit-case.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, what&#8217;s up, Dad?&#8221; he exclaimed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are off for Watson Siding in twenty minutes,
to take charge of the station there nights,&#8221; said his
father. &#8220;The regular man is ill, the despatcher had
no one else to send, and asked for you, and of course
I told him you&#8217;d be delighted.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Delighted? Well, rather!&#8221; cried Alex, gleefully,
and throwing his school-books into a corner, he dashed
up-stairs to change his clothes, hastily ate a lunch his
mother had prepared, and fifteen minutes later was
hurrying for the depot.
</p>
<p>Needless to say Alex was a proud boy when shortly
after seven o&#8217;clock he reached Watson Siding, and at
once took over the station for the night. For it is
not often a lad of fourteen is given such responsibility,
even though brought up on the railroad.
</p>
<p>Alex was soon to learn that the responsibility was a
very real one. The first night passed pleasantly
enough, but early the succeeding night, following a
day of rain, a heavy spring fog set in, and shortly before
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
ten o&#8217;clock Alex found, to his alarm, that he could
not make himself heard on the wire by the despatcher.
Evidently there was a heavy escape of current between
them, because of the dampness.
</p>
<p>Again the despatcher called, again Alex sought to
interrupt him, failed, and gave it up. &#8220;Now I am
in for trouble,&#8221; he said in dismay. &#8220;If anything
should&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>From apparently just without came a low, ominous
rumble, then a crash. Alex started to his feet and
ran to the window. He could see nothing but fog,
and hastily securing a lantern, went out onto the station
platform.
</p>
<p>As he closed the door there was a second terrific
crash, from the darkness immediately opposite, and a
rain of stones rattling against iron.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The bank above the siding!&#8221; cried Alex, and
springing to the tracks, he dashed across, and with an
exclamation brought up before a mound of earth six
feet high over the siding rails.
</p>
<p>As he gazed Alex felt his heart tighten. The westbound
Sunset Express was due to take the siding in
less than half an hour, to await the Eastern Mail, and
at once he saw that if the engineer misjudged the distance
in the fog, and ran onto the siding at full speed,
there would be a terrible calamity.
</p>
<p>And suppose the cars were thrown onto the main
line track, and the Mail crashed into them! And, apparently,
he could not reach the despatcher, to give
warning of her danger!
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span></p>
<p>What could he do to stop them? Helplessly Alex
looked at the lantern in his hand. Its light was
smothered by the fog within ten feet of him.
</p>
<p>Running back to the operating room he seized the
key and once more sought to attract the attention of the
despatcher. It was useless. The despatcher did not
hear him. He sank back in his chair, sick with dread.
</p>
<p>But he must attempt something! Determinedly he
sprang to his feet. A lantern was useless. Then why
not a fire? A big fire on the track? Hurrah! That
was it! But&mdash;he gazed at the coal box, and thought
of the rain soaked wood outside, and his heart sank.
Then came remembrance of the big woodshed at the
farm-house where he boarded, three hundred yards
away, and in a moment he had recovered the lantern,
and was out, and off through the darkness, running
desperately.
</p>
<p>On arriving at the house Alex found all in silence,
and the family retired, but without a moment&#8217;s hesitation
he threw himself at the front door, pounding
upon it with his fists.
</p>
<p>It seemed an age before a window was raised.
&#8220;Mr. Moore,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;there has been a landslide
in the cut at the station, and there is danger of the
Sunset running into it. May I have wood from the
shed to make a fire on the track to stop her?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Gracious! Certainly, certainly!&#8221; exclaimed the
voice from the window. &#8220;And the boys and I will
be down in a minute to help you. You run around
and be pulling out some kindling.&#8221;
</p>
<div class='figcenter'>

THREW HIMSELF AT THE FRONT DOOR, POUNDING UPON IT<br />
WITH HIS FISTS.
<br />
</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span></div>
<p>Alex darted about to the woodshed, there the farmer
and his two sons soon joined him, and each catching
up an armful of wood, they were quickly off for the
railroad, Alex leading with the lantern.
</p>
<p>Reaching the tracks, they hurried east, and a quarter
mile distant halted, and began hastily building a
huge bonfire between the rails.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There,&#8221; said Alex, as the flames leaped up, &#8220;that
ought to stop her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And now, Mr. Moore, suppose we leave Dick here
to tend the fire, and you and Billy and I hurry back
to the station, and tackle the earth on the track. We
may get enough off to let the train plow through.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, certainly,&#8221; agreed the farmer; and retracing
their steps, the three secured shovels and more
lanterns at the depot, and soon were hard at work on
the obstructed siding.
</p>
<p>They had been digging some ten minutes when suddenly
Billy paused. &#8220;Listen,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There&#8217;s a
horse coming, on the run.&#8221; His father and Alex also
ceased shoveling, and a moment later the quick pounding
of horse&#8217;s hoofs was plainly discernible.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It must be something urgent to make a man drive
like that in the dark,&#8221; said Mr. Moore.
</p>
<p>The racing hoofs drew nearer, and placing his hands
to his mouth he cried: &#8220;Hello! What&#8217;s up?&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was a sound of scrambling and plunging, and
out of the darkness came a man&#8217;s excited voice: &#8220;How
near am I to the station?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Right here below you!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Thank God! Run quick and tell the operator
there has been a landslip in the big cutting just beyond
the river! My son discovered it when coming home
by the track from a party! I thought I could get here
quicker than do anything else!&#8221;
</p>
<p>For a moment Alex stood speechless at this further
calamity, then once more dashed for the station. To
reach Zeisler, two miles west of the cut, was the only
hope for the Mail.
</p>
<p>Rushing in to the instruments, he in feverish haste began
calling &#8220;Z. Z, Z,&#8221; he whirled. &#8220;Qk! Z, Z, WS!&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was no answer. Z heard him no more than
did the despatcher.
</p>
<p>A feeling of despair settled upon the boy. But again
returned the old spirit of determination and contriving,
and spinning about in his chair, he cast his eyes around
the room for some suggestion. They halted at the big
stoneware water-cooler. With a cry he was on his
feet, thinking rapidly.
</p>
<p>Only a few hours before, during an idle moment,
the similarity of the big jar to a gravity cell had occurred
to him, and the speculation as to whether it
could not be turned into a battery if need be.
</p>
<p>Could he really make a battery of it? If he could,
undoubtedly it would be strong enough to so increase
the current in the wire that both Zeisler and the despatcher
could hear him.
</p>
<p>He ran to a little storage closet at the rear of the
room. Yes; there was enough bluestone! But no
copper, or zinc! What could he do for that?
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span></p>
<p>As though directed by Providence, his gaze fell on
the floor-board of the office stove. It was covered with
a sheet of zinc! And even as he uttered a glad
&#8220;Good!&#8221; there came the remembrance that at the
house that afternoon he had seen a fine new wash-boiler&mdash;with
a thick copper bottom.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it,&#8221; cried Alex, again catching up the lantern
and darting for the door.
</p>
<p>A short distance from the depot Alex was halted by
a long, muffled whistle from the east. &#8220;The Express,&#8221;
he exclaimed, and in keen anxiety awaited the next
whistle. Would it be for the crossing this side of the
bonfire, or&mdash;
</p>
<p>It came, a series of quick, sharp toots. Yes; they
had seen the fire!
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank Heaven! She&#8217;s safe at any rate,&#8221; said
Alex, at once running on.
</p>
<p>A few minutes later he burst into Mrs. Moore&#8217;s
kitchen. The farmer&#8217;s wife was at the stove, preparing
coffee for them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Moore, where is your new copper-bottomed
boiler? I must have it, quick,&#8221; said Alex.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What! My new wash-boiler?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; the copper-bottomed one. It&#8217;s a matter of
life and death!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The astonished woman hesitated, then, wonderingly,
pointed toward the outer kitchen. Alex ran
thither, and quickly reappeared with the fine new
boiler on his shoulder.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And I must have that kettle of boiling water,&#8221; he
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
added, on a thought. &#8220;I&#8217;ll explain later.&#8221; And
catching it from the stove, he rushed away.
</p>
<p>As he ran Alex further thought out his plans, and
once more at the station, he placed the kettle on the
office stove, emptied the bluestone into it, and poked
up the fire.
</p>
<p>Then, with a hammer and chisel, he attacked the
copper bottom of the boiler.
</p>
<p>He was still pounding and cutting when presently
there was the sound of hurried footsteps without, the
door flew open, and a voice exclaimed: &#8220;In Heaven&#8217;s
name, young man, what are you doing? Why are you
not at your wire, trying to stop the other train?&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was none other than the division superintendent
of the road, who had been aboard the Sunset.
</p>
<p>Only pausing a moment in his work, Alex replied:
&#8220;I can&#8217;t reach anybody, sir, the wire is so weak. I
am making a battery of that water-cooler, to
strengthen it. It&#8217;s the only hope, sir.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The superintendent uttered a horrified exclamation,
then quickly added: &#8220;Here, can&#8217;t I help you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; replied Alex, promptly. &#8220;Lift up the
stove and slide out the floor-board. I must have the
sheet of zinc off it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And a few minutes later a group of passengers from
the stalled train, seeking the cause of delay, paused
in the doorway to gaze in blank astonishment at the
spectacle of the division superintendent of the Middle
Western, his coat off, energetically working under the
direction of his youngest operator.
</p>

<p class='caption' style='text-align:center;'>
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR, THE CENTER OF ALL EYES,<br />
HURRIEDLY WORKING WITH CHISEL AND HAMMER.
<br />
</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span></div>
<p>&#8220;There you are, my lad,&#8221; said the superintendent.
&#8220;What next?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Get a stick, sir, and stir the bluestone in the kettle.
We must have it dissolved if the battery is to work
the moment we connect it to the wire.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The copper bottom of the boiler was at last cut
through, and hastily doubling it over several times,
in order that it would lie flat in the crock, Alex turned
his attention to the zinc on the stove-board.
</p>
<p>The scene in the little station had now become
dramatic&mdash;the crowd of passengers, increased until it
half filled the room, looking on in strained silence, or
talking in whispers; the tall figure of the superintendent
at the stove, busily stirring the kettle, and in the
middle of the floor, the center of all eyes, the fourteen-year-old
boy hurriedly working with chisel and hammer,
seemingly only conscious of the task before him
and the necessity of making the most of every minute.
</p>
<p>The zinc was cut, and hurriedly folding it as he had
the copper, Alex sprang to his feet, and running to
the cupboard, dragged out a bundle of wire, and began
sorting out a number of short ends.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How much longer?&#8221; said the superintendent in a
tense voice. &#8220;The train should be at Zeisler now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just a minute. But she&#8217;s sure to be a little late,
from the fog,&#8221; said Alex, hopefully, never pausing.
&#8220;Has the bluestone dissolved, sir?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All but a few lumps.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then that&#8217;ll do. Now please lift down the water-cooler,
sir, and place it by the table.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span></p>
<p>As the superintendent complied all conversation
ceased, and the crowd, moving hurriedly out of the
way, looked on breathlessly, then turned to Alex, on
his knees, fastening two pieces of wire to the squares
of copper and zinc.
</p>
<p>This done, Alex dropped the square of copper to
the bottom of the big jar, hung the zinc from the top,
connected one wire end to the ground connection at
the switchboard, and the other to the side of the key.
And the task was complete.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now the kettle, sir,&#8221; he said, dropping into his
chair. The superintendent seized the kettle, and emptied
its blue-green liquid into the cooler. The moment
the water had covered the zinc Alex opened his key.
</p>
<p>It worked strongly and sharply.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank God! Thank God!&#8221; said the superintendent,
fervently. &#8220;Now, hurry, boy!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Already Alex was whirring off a string of letters.
&#8220;Z, Z, Z, WS!&#8221; he called. &#8220;Qk! Qk! Z, Z&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>The line opened, and at the quick sharp dots that
came Alex could not restrain a cry of triumph. &#8220;It
works! I&#8217;ve got him,&#8221; he exclaimed. Then rapidly
he sent:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Has Number 12 passed?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The line again opened, and over the boy leaned a
circle of white, anxious faces. Had the train passed?
Had it gone on to destruction? Or&mdash;
</p>
<p>The instruments clicked. &#8220;No! No! He says,
no!&#8221; cried Alex.
</p>
<p>And then, while the crowd about him relieved its
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
pent-up feelings in wild shouts and hurrahs, Alex
quickly sent the order to stop the train.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And now three good cheers for the little operator,&#8221;
said one of the passengers as Alex closed his
key. In confusion Alex drew back in his chair, then
suddenly recollecting the others who had taken part
in the night&#8217;s work, he told the superintendent of the
part played by Mr. Moore and his sons, and of the
sacrifice of Mrs. Moore&#8217;s new wash-boiler.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And then there was the man on the horse, who
told us of the slide in the cut across the river. He
was the real one to save the Mail,&#8221; said Alex, modestly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I see you are as fair as you are ingenious,&#8221; said
the superintendent, smiling. &#8220;We&#8217;ll look after them
all, you may be sure. By the first express Mrs. Moore
shall have two, instead of one, of the finest boilers
money can buy. And as for you, my boy, I&#8217;ll see that
you are given a permanent station within a year, if
you wish to take it. We need resourceful operators
like you.&#8221;

<h2>III</h2>
<h3>A TINKER WHO MADE GOOD</h3>
</div>

<p>Most telegraph operators, young operators especially,
have a number of over-the-wire
friends. Alex Ward&#8217;s particular telegraph chum was
Jack Orr, or &#8220;OR,&#8221; as he knew him on the wire, a
lad of just his own age, son of the proprietor of the
drug-store in which the town, or commercial, office
was located at Haddowville, a small place at the end
of the line. The two boys had become warm friends
through &#8220;sending&#8221; for one another&#8217;s improvement in
&#8220;reading,&#8221; in the evenings when the wire was idle;
but also because of the similarities of taste they had
discovered. Both were fond of experimenting, and
learning the &#8220;why and wherefore&#8221; of things electrical.
</p>
<p>And not infrequently they got themselves into
trouble, as young investigators will.
</p>
<p>One evening that summer, the instruments being
silent, Jack, at Haddowville, bethought himself of
taking the relay, the main receiving instrument, to
pieces, to discover exactly how the wire connections
in the base were arranged. To think with Jack was
to act. Half an hour later his father, entering with
an important message, found Jack with the instrument
in a dozen pieces.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span></p>
<p>Mr. Orr viewed the muss with consternation. Then
he spoke sharply. &#8220;Jack, if that relay is not together
again, and working, in five minutes, I&#8217;ll take you out
to the woodshed!&#8221; Needless to say, Jack threw himself
into the restoring of the instrument with ardor,
while his father stood grimly by. And fortunately the
relay was in its place again, and clicking, within the
prescribed time.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But don&#8217;t let me ever catch you tinkering with the
instruments again,&#8221; said Jack&#8217;s father warningly, as
he gave Jack the message to send. &#8220;Another time
it&#8217;ll be the woodshed whether you get them together
or no. Remember!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Shortly after midnight the night following Jack
suddenly found himself sitting up in bed, wondering
what had awakened him. From the street below came
the sound of running feet, simultaneously the window
lighted with a yellow glare, and with a bound and an
exclamation of &#8220;Fire!&#8221; Jack was across the room and
peering out.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Jones&#8217; coal sheds! Or the station!&#8221; he ejaculated,
and in a moment was back at the bedside, dressing as
only a boy can dress for a fire. Running to his parents&#8217;
bedroom he told them of his going, and was down the
stairs and out into the street in a trice.
</p>
<p>Dim figures of men and other boys were hurrying
by in the direction of the town fire-hall, a block distant,
and on the run Jack also headed thither. For
to help pull the fire-engine or hose-cart to a fire was
the ardent hobby of every lad in town.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span></p>
<p>A half dozen members of the volunteer fire company
and as many boys were at the doors when Jack arrived,
and the fire chief, already equipped with helmet
and speaking-trumpet, was fumbling at the lock.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is it, Billy?&#8221; inquired Jack of a boy acquaintance.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They say it&#8217;s the station and freight shed, and
Johnson&#8217;s lumber yard, and the coal sheds&mdash;the whole
shooting match,&#8221; said Billy, hopefully.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Bully!&#8221; responded Jack; who, never having seen
his own home in flames, likewise regarded fires as
the most thrilling sort of entertainment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Out of the way!&#8221; cried the chief. The big doors
swung open, and with a rush the little crowd divided
and went at the old-fashioned hand-engine and the
hose-cart. Billy and Jack secured the particular prize,
the head of the engine drag-rope, and like a pair of
young colts pranced out with it to its full length.
Others seized it, and with the cry of &#8220;Let &#8217;er go!&#8221;
they went rumbling forth, and swung up the street.
</p>
<p>The hose-cart, with its automatic gong, clanged out
immediately after, and the race that always occurred
was on. The engine of course had the start, but the
hose-cart, a huge two-wheeled reel, about which the
hose was wound, was much lighter, and speedily was
clanging abreast of them. Here, however, Big Ed.
Hicks, the blacksmith, and Nick White, a colored
giant, rushed up, dodged beneath the rope, and took
their accustomed places at the tongue, and with a
burst of speed the engine began to draw ahead. Other
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
firemen appeared from side streets and banging doorways,
and took their places on the rope, and a shout
from the juvenile contingent presently announced that
the reel was falling to the rear.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile the glare in the sky had brightened and
spread; and when at last the rumbling engine swung
into the station road the whole sky was ablaze. Overhead,
before a stiff wind, large embers and sparks were
beginning to fly.
</p>
<p>With a dash the panting company swept into the
station square. Before them the station and adjoining
freight-shed were enveloped in flames from end
to end. It was apparent at once that there was no
possibility of saving either. But with a final rush the
engine-squad made for the fire-well at the corner of
the square, brought up all-standing, and in a jiffy the
intake pipe was unstrapped and dropped into the water.
The reel clanged up, two of its crew sprang for the
engine with the hose-end and couplers, and the cart
sped on, peeling the hose out behind it.
</p>
<p>The speed with which they could get into action
was a matter of pride with the Haddowville firemen.
Almost before the coupling had been made at the
engine the men and boys at the long pumping-bars
were working them gently; within the minute a shout
from the cart announced that the hose was being
broken, the pumpers threw themselves into the work
with zest, and the next moment from the distant nozzle
shot a sputtering stream.
</p>
<p>With the other boys, Jack, though now considerably
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
winded, was throwing himself energetically up and
down against one of the long handles. Before many
minutes, however, the remainder of the regular enginemen
appeared, and took their places, and presently
Jack also was ousted.
</p>
<p>At once he set off for a closer view of the fire.
Half way he was halted by a call.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hi, Jack! Come and help push the freight cars!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The shout came from a group of boys running for
the rear of the burning freight-shed, and responding
with alacrity, Jack joined them, and soon, just beyond
the burning building, was pushing against the corner
of a slowly moving box-car with all his might.
</p>
<p>One car was rolled safely out of the danger zone,
and Jack&#8217;s party hastened back for another. The innermost
of the remaining cars, and on a separate siding,
was but a short distance from the flaming shed,
and already was blazing on the roof. Jack and several
other adventurous spirits determined to tackle this one
on their own account. After much straining they got
it in motion.
</p>
<p>Suddenly a wildly excited figure appeared rushing
through the smoke, and shouted at the top of his voice,
&#8220;Get back! Get back! There&#8217;s blasting powder in
that car!&#8221;
</p>
<p>In a twinkle there was a wild stampede. And but
just in time. With a blinding flash and a roar like
a thunderbolt, the car shot into the air in a million
pieces. Many persons in the vicinity were thrown
violently to the ground, including Jack. As he scrambled,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
thoroughly frightened, to his feet, someone
shouted, &#8220;Look out overhead!&#8221; and glancing up, Jack
saw a shower of burning fragments high in the air.
</p>
<p>Then rose the cry, &#8220;The wind is taking them right
over the town!&#8221; In alarm many people began leaving
the square for their homes.
</p>
<p>Jack&#8217;s own home and the drug-store block were well
on the other side of the town, however, and with no
thought of anxiety Jack remained to watch the burning
station, now a solid mass of flame from ground to roof.
</p>
<p>Presently, glancing toward the opposite corner of
the square, Jack noted a general, hurried movement
of the crowd there into the street. He set out to investigate.
As he neared the fire-engine, still clanking
vigorously, a bareheaded man rushed up and asked excitedly
for the fire chief. &#8220;The telephone building and
a house on Essex Street, and one on the next street
back, are burning!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Quick, and do something,
or the whole town will be afire!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Looking in the direction indicated, Jack saw a
wavering glare, and with a new thrill of excitement
was immediately off on the run. The telephone exchange
was one of the largest buildings in town.
</p>
<p>As he came within sight of the new conflagration
the flames already were leaping from the roof and
roaring from the upper windows. Despite the heat,
the crowd before the building was clustered close about
the door of the telephone office, and Jack hastened to
join them, to learn the cause. Making his way through
the throng, he reached the front as a blanketed figure
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
staggered, smoking, from the doorway. Someone
sprang forward and caught the blanket from the
stumbling man, at the same time crying, &#8220;Did you
get them?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; gasped the telephone operator, for Jack saw
it was he; &#8220;the whole office is in flames. I couldn&#8217;t
get inside the door.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mayor Davis, the first speaker, turned quickly
about. &#8220;Then we&#8217;ll run down to Orr&#8217;s and telegraph.&#8221;
</p>
<p>At once Jack understood. The mayor wished to
send for help from other towns. He sprang forward.
&#8220;I&#8217;m here, Mr. Davis&mdash;Jack Orr. I&#8217;ll take a message!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; said the mayor. &#8220;Run like the wind,
my boy, and send a telegram to the mayors of Zeisler
and Hammerton for help. As many steam engines
as they can spare. And have the railroad people supply
a special at once. Write the message yourself,
and sign my name. Tell them four more fires have
broken out, and that the whole town may be in danger.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jack broke through the crowd, and was off like a
deer.
</p>
<p>Farther down the street he passed another building,
a small dwelling, burning, with its frightened occupants
and their neighbors hurrying furniture out, and
fighting the flames with buckets.
</p>
<p>Down the next cross-street he saw flames bursting
from a second house.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span></p>
<p>Then it was that the real gravity of the situation
began to come home to Jack. Till now it had all been
only a thrilling drama&mdash;even the bearing of the
mayor&#8217;s urgent message had appeared rather a dramatically
prominent stage-part he had had thrust upon
him.
</p>
<p>On he sped with redoubled speed, and turned into
the main street. Then his alarm became genuine.
Lurid flames were licking over the tree-tops directly
ahead of him&mdash;in the direction of the store! A
moment later a cry of horror broke from him. It
was indeed the store block!
</p>
<p>But his own personal alarm was quickly lost in a
greater. Suppose the telegraph office also should be
in flames, and he unable to reach it? He ran on
madly.
</p>
<p>He neared the store, and with hope saw that so far
the flames were only in the second story. Men were
hurrying in and out, and from the hardware-store adjoining.
But as he rushed to the drug-store door a
cloud of heavy smoke rolled forth, driving a group
of men before it.
</p>
<p>Among them he recognized his father.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dad,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;can&#8217;t I reach the instruments?
I&#8217;ve a message for help to Hammerton and Zeisler
from the mayor! The &#8217;phone office and the station
are burned. There is no other way of getting word
out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mr. Orr had halted in consternation. &#8220;No; you
couldn&#8217;t get to them. The telegraph room is a furnace.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
The fire came in through the office windows
from the outhouse, and I closed the door from the
store.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Through the haze of smoke within burst a lurid
fork of flame.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There! The fire is out through the telegraph-room
door,&#8221; said the druggist. &#8220;You couldn&#8217;t get
near the table. And anyway, Jack, the instruments
would be useless by this time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was this remark that aroused Jack. &#8220;If I could
rip them from the table in any kind of shape, perhaps
I could fix them up quickly so I could use them,&#8221; he
thought.
</p>
<p>To his father he said with sudden determination,
&#8220;Dad, I&#8217;m going to make a try for the key and
relay.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No. I won&#8217;t permit it,&#8221; declared Mr. Orr decisively.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But father, if we don&#8217;t get word out the whole
town may be burned,&#8221; cried Jack.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll make a try myself,&#8221; said Mr. Orr, and without
further word lowered his head and dashed back
into the smoke.
</p>
<p>While Jack stood anxiously awaiting his father&#8217;s
reappearance the owner of the adjacent hardware-store
stumbled from his doorway under a bundle of
horse-blankets. With an immediate idea Jack ran
toward him. &#8220;Mr. Wells, let me have some of those
blankets,&#8221; he said hurriedly. &#8220;We want to try and
reach the telegraph instruments. They are the only
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
hope for getting word out of town for help. Father
is in after them, but I don&#8217;t think he can reach them
with nothing over him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The merchant promptly threw the whole bundle to
the ground. &#8220;Help yourself,&#8221; he directed.
</p>
<p>At the door again, he called back. &#8220;Can you use
anything else?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No&mdash;Say, yes! A pair of leather gauntlets.&#8221;
The merchant disappeared, reappeared, and threw
toward Jack a bundle of leather gloves. &#8220;Many as
you want,&#8221; he shouted.
</p>
<p>Catching them up and two of the blankets, Jack
sprang back for their own store as his father reappeared.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They can&#8217;t be reached,&#8221; coughed Mr. Orr.
&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t even get to the door.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll try with these blankets, then,&#8221; said Jack decisively.
&#8220;Throw them over my head, please.&#8221;
</p>
<p>His father hesitated. &#8220;But my boy&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s little danger, Dad. The blankets are
thick. And I know just where the instruments are.
And see, I&#8217;ll wear these gauntlets,&#8221; he added, pulling
a pair over his hands.
</p>
<p>Somewhat reluctantly Mr. Orr took the blankets
and threw them over Jack&#8217;s head, and on the run
Jack plunged into the wall of smoke.
</p>
<p>With one gloved hand outstretched he found the
telegraph-room door, and the knob. He pressed
against it, and with a crash and then a roar the door
collapsed before him. But without a moment&#8217;s hesitation
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
he darted on within, groped his way to the
table, found the relay, and with a desperate wrench
tore it from its place. The next moment he dashed
blindly into his father&#8217;s arms at the outer door, and
threw the smoking blankets and sizzling, burning relay
to the sidewalk.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Water on it quick,&#8221; gasped Jack, pointing to the
instrument. Catching it up in a corner of one of the
blankets Mr. Orr ran with it to a horse-trough in
front, and plunged it into the water.
</p>
<p>As he returned Jack was drawing on a second pair
of gauntlets.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Jack, you&#8217;re not going back!&#8221; said his father
sharply.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I want the key, Dad.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Look there.&#8221; Glancing within Jack saw that the
whole rear of the store was now enveloped in flames.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And it would be of no use in any case. Look at
this,&#8221; said Mr. Orr, holding up the smoking relay.
</p>
<p>The instrument did indeed look a hopeless wreck
as Jack took it. The base was cracked and charred,
the rubber jacket about the magnet-coils was frizzled
and warped, the fine wire connections beneath were
gone, and the armature spring was missing.
</p>
<p>But Jack was not one to give up while a single hope
remained. &#8220;I could improvise a key,&#8221; he said, and
with decision hastily sought the hardware merchant.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Wells, did you save any screw-drivers?&#8221; he
asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;In a box down there. Help yourself.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span></p>
<p>Running thither Jack found the tool, and immediately
began taking the relay apart.
</p>
<p>An exclamation of disappointment greeted the discovery
that the fine copper wire within one of the
coil-jackets had been melted into a solid mass. On
ripping open the sizzled jacket of the other, however,
Jack found the silk covering the wire to be only
scorched, and determined to do the best he could with
the one magnet.
</p>
<p>Removing the relay entirely from the burned base,
he secured a thin piece of board from one of the boxes
near him, from the miscellaneous tools in another box
found a gimlet, and made the necessary perforations.
And soon he had the brass coil-frame mounted.
</p>
<p>Meantime Mr. Orr, not for a moment thinking
Jack could do anything with the charred instrument,
had joined the crowd of men and women watching
the burning building from across the street.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Father! Here, please!&#8221; called Jack.
</p>
<p>In some wonder Mr. Orr responded, and with him
the hardware merchant.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you a rubber band in your pocket?&#8221; asked
Jack. &#8220;I want it for the armature spring.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why you are really not doing anything with it,
Jack!&#8221; exclaimed his father.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir. I think I can make it go,&#8221; responded
Jack with a little touch of elation. &#8220;And with only
one magnet. But have you the rubber?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here,&#8221; said Mr. Wells, snapping a rubber band
from his pocketbook. &#8220;This do?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Just the thing. Thanks.&#8221; And while the two
men looked on, Jack secured one end of the elastic to
the little hook on the armature, and knotted the other
about the tension thumb-screw.
</p>
<p>That done, Jack caught up a hammer and smashed
the useless coil to pieces, from the wreck, secured several
intact ends of the fine wire, and with them
quickly restored the burnt connections between the
magnet and the binding-posts. And with a cry, half
of jubilation and half of nervous excitement, he
caught up the now roughly-restored instrument and
ran toward an iron gas street-lamp. In the roadway
a short distance from the lamp-post lay the burned-off
end of the telegraph wire. Placing the instrument
on the sidewalk, Jack ran for the wire, and dragged
it also to the post.
</p>
<p>Then, as the crowd, following his father and the
hardware merchant, gathered about him, they saw him
secure a piece of wire about the iron lamp-post, then
to the instrument; and, dropping to a sitting position,
place the instrument on his knees, catch up the telegraph
line, and hold it to the other side of the relay.
</p>
<p>Jack&#8217;s low cry of disappointment was echoed by his
father. &#8220;No use. I was afraid of it, my boy,&#8221; said
Mr. Orr resignedly.
</p>
<p>There was a disturbance on the outskirts of the
crowd, and the mayor appeared pushing his way
through. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t you get that message off, Jack?&#8221;
he cried excitedly.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The fire was too quick for us,&#8221; said Mr. Orr.
&#8220;Jack risked his life getting out one of the instruments.
But it has proved useless.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh say! Now I know what&#8217;s the matter!&#8221;
With the cry Jack sprang to his feet, broke through
the circle about him, and sped back toward the store.
The flames were now bursting from the front, but
with head down he ran to the iron door covering the
street entrance to the cellar, and lifted it. A thin
stream of smoke arose, then disappeared as a draft
toward the rear set in. With a thankful &#8220;Good!&#8221;
Jack leaped into the opening.
</p>
<p>His father, the mayor, and several others who had
rushed after in consternation reached the sidewalk as
Jack&#8217;s head reappeared, followed by a green battery
jar. Placing the jar on the ledge, he stooped, and
raised another.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you think you are doing?&#8221; cried his
father.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll explain in a minute. Take them over to the
post, please.&#8221; And Jack had again disappeared.
</p>
<p>The mayor promptly caught up the two cells, but
Mr. Orr as promptly dropped through the opening
and followed Jack.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you trying to do?&#8221; he demanded as he
groped his way to the battery-shelf. &#8220;You can&#8217;t do
anything with the battery if you have no instrument.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The instrument is all right, Father. The line has
been &#8216;grounded&#8217; south, that&#8217;s all. If we put battery
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
on here, we can reach some office between here and
wherever the &#8216;ground&#8217; is on.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;May it be so,&#8221; said Mr. Orr fervently, but not
hopefully, as they hurried with four more jars to the
entrance.
</p>
<p>When they had carried out a dozen jars Jack declared
the number to be sufficient, and scrambling
forth, they hastened back to the lamp-post.
</p>
<p>Without delay Jack connected the cells in proper
series, and removing the wire between the instrument
and the iron post, substituted the battery&mdash;zinc to
the post, and copper to the instrument.
</p>
<p>Then once more he caught up the severed end of
the main-line wire, and touched the opposite side of
the instrument.
</p>
<p>A cry of triumph, then a mighty shout, greeted the
responding click.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But what about a key, son?&#8221; said Mr. Orr.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This, for the moment,&#8221; replied Jack, and simply
resting his elbow on his knee, and tapping with the
end of the wire against the brass binding-post, he
began urgently calling.
</p>
<p>&#8220;HN, HN, HN!&#8221; he clicked. &#8220;HN, HN, HV!
Rush! Qk! HN, HN!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps the wire is grounded between here and
Hammerton,&#8221; suggested his father breathlessly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Anybody answer! Qk!&#8221; sent Jack. &#8220;Does anybody
hear this?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter? This is Z.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Got Zeisler!&#8221; shouted Jack.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span></p>
<p>The mayor stepped forward. &#8220;Send them the
message,&#8221; he directed, &#8220;and have them &#8217;phone it to
Hammerton.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jack did so. And fifteen minutes later the cheering
news ran quickly about the threatened town that
two steam fire-engines were starting by special train
from Hammerton immediately, would pick up another
at Zeisler, and would be on the scene within half an
hour. All of which report proved true, the engines
arriving on the dot&mdash;and by daylight the last of the
several different fires were under control, and the
safety of the town was assured.
</p>
<p>Needless to say, Jack&#8217;s name played an important
part in the dramatic newspaper accounts of the conflagration&mdash;nor
to add that he was the envied hero
of every other lad in town for weeks to come.
</p>
<p>The final and particular result of the affair, however,
was the offer to Jack of a good position in
the large commercial telegraph office at Hammerton,
which he at last induced his parents to permit him to
accept.

<h2>IV</h2>
<h3>THE OTHER TINKER ALSO MAKES GOOD</h3>
</div>

<p>One evening shortly after the beginning of the
summer holidays Alex was chatting over the
wire with Jack, who was now a full-fledged operator
at Hammerton, when the despatching office abruptly
broke in and called Bixton.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I, I, BX,&#8221; answered Alex.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is young Ward there?&#8221; clicked the instruments.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is &#8216;young Ward.&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, youngster, would you care to do a couple
of weeks&#8217; vacation relief at Hadley Corners, beginning
next Monday? The man there wants to get off
badly, and we have no one here we can send.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Most certainly I would,&#8221; replied Alex, promptly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;OK then. We&#8217;ll count on you. I&#8217;ll send a pass
down to-night,&#8221; said the despatcher.
</p>
<p>Thus it came about that the following Monday
morning Alex alighted at the little crossing depot
known as Hadley Corners, and for the second time
found himself, if but temporarily, in full charge of a
station.
</p>
<p>Entering the little telegraph room, he announced
his arrival to the despatcher at &#8220;X.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; clicked the sounder. &#8220;And now, look
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
here, Ward. Don&#8217;t do any tinkering with the instruments
while you are there. We don&#8217;t want a repetition
of the mix-up you got the wire into at BX through
your joking a month or so ago.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The joke referred to was a hoax Alex had played
on his father the previous First of April. Through
an arrangement of wires beneath the office table, by
which with his foot, unseen, he could make the instruments
above click as though worked from another office,
he had called his father to the wire, and posing
as the despatcher, had severely reprimanded him for
some imaginary mistake in a train order. It had been
&#8220;all kinds of a lark,&#8221; until, unfortunately, the connections
became disarranged, tying up the entire
eastern end of the line for half an hour.
</p>
<p>At the recollection of the escapade Alex laughed
heartily. Nevertheless he promptly replied, &#8220;OK,
sir. I won&#8217;t touch a thing.&#8221; And the despatcher saying
nothing more, he began calling Bixton.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m here, Dad,&#8221; he announced when his father
answered; &#8220;and it&#8217;s a fine little place. The woods
come almost up to the back of the station, and the
nearest house is a mile away. That&#8217;s where I am to
board. The other operator arranged it. It&#8217;s going
to be a regular little picnic.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s nice,&#8221; ticked the sounder. &#8220;I thought
you would like it.&#8221; And then Alex again laughed as
his father added, &#8220;And now, no tinkering with things,
my boy! Remember!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;OK, Dad. I won&#8217;t touch a thing. Good-by.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span></p>
<p>It was the following Monday that the &#8220;all agents&#8221;
message was sent over the wire announcing an unusually
heavy shipment of gold from the Black Hill
Mines, and warning station agents and operators to
look out for and report any suspicious persons about
their stations. But these messages, usually following
hold-ups on other roads, had been intermittently sent
for years, and nothing had happened on the Middle
Western; and in his turn Alex gave his &#8220;OK,&#8221; and
thought nothing more about it.
</p>
<p>A half hour later he sat at the open window of the
telegraph room, deeply interested in the July <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>St. Nicholas</span>&mdash;so interested, indeed, that he did not
hear soft footfalls on the station platform without.
The man came quietly nearer&mdash;reached the window.
Then suddenly Alex glanced up, the magazine fell to
the floor, and with a loud cry he sprang to his feet.
</p>
<p>He was gazing into the barrel of a revolver, and
behind it was a black-masked face!
</p>
<p>Hold-up men! The gold train!
</p>
<p>Wildly Alex turned toward the telegraph-key. But
the man leaned quickly forward, seized him by the
shoulder, and threw him heavily back into the chair.
&#8220;You move again and I&#8217;ll shoot!&#8221; he said sharply,
and Alex sank back helpless.
</p>
<p>Yes; hold-up men. And he had betrayed his trust.
Betrayed his trust! That thought stood out even
above his terror. Oh, if he had only kept a lookout!
</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
<a name='linki_6' id='linki_6'></a>
<img src='images/illus-057.jpg' alt='' title='' /><br />
<p class='caption' style='text-align:center;'>
HE WAS GAZING INTO THE BARREL OF A REVOLVER.
<br />
</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span></div>
<p>The man, who had said nothing further, presently
withdrew the revolver and took a comfortable seat on
the window-ledge. As the silence continued, Alex
began somewhat to recover himself, and fell to wondering
what the other bandits were doing while this
man was watching him.
</p>
<p>A few moments later the answer came in a single
upward click from the instruments.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&mdash;wires cut, ain&#8217;t they?&#8221; said his captor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I suppose,&#8221; said Alex, bitterly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They sure are,&#8221; said the voice from behind the
mask. &#8220;And when we get through, them wires&#8217;ll be
cut so you won&#8217;t be able to fix &#8217;em up in a hurry.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Fifteen minutes later a second masked and heavily
armed figure appeared. &#8220;Every wire cut five poles
back on either side of the station,&#8221; he announced
briefly. &#8220;It&#8217;ll take a lineman half a day to fix &#8217;em
up again, and we&#8217;ll be twenty miles away by that
time. Now we&#8217;ll put the hobbles on the youngster,
and git.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Often Alex had longed for just such an adventure
as this. The final disenchantment was anything but
glorious. Roughly seizing him, the two men forced
him stiffly upright in the chair, drew his arms about
the back of it, and there secured them, wrist to wrist,
drawing the knot until Alex almost cried out in pain.
Then, as tightly, they bound his ankles to the lower
rungs, one on either side.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now one of us is going to watch from the woods
for a spell&mdash;we&#8217;ll leave the back door open, so we
can see right in&mdash;and if you make a move, you get
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
this quick! See?&#8221; said one of the desperadoes, tapping
his pistol significantly.
</p>
<p>Therewith they passed out, leaving the rear door
wide open, and in utter misery of mind Alex watched
them stride toward the trees.
</p>
<p>Before the two bandits had crossed the open space,
however, Alex&#8217;s mind had cleared. For plainly they
were hurrying! Then their promise to watch him
must have been only a threat, to keep him quiet!
Good! At once he began straining at his wrists,
paused as the two men reached the edge of the clearing
and momentarily turned, and as they disappeared
amid the trees, began struggling with grim determination.
</p>
<p>It seemed a hopeless task at first, and the rawhide
thongs cut cruelly into Alex&#8217;s wrists and ankles. But
bravely he struggled on, wriggled and twisted, paused
for breath, and struggled again. And finally one hand
came suddenly free.
</p>
<p>It required but a few seconds to get into his pocket,
reach his knife, and open it with his teeth. A moment
later Alex was on his feet, and staggered out onto
the platform.
</p>
<p>Yes, the wires were cut, five poles in either direction!
Alex clenched his hands. After all, what could
he do? To restore the line was entirely out of the
question. Had there been but one break he could not
have climbed the pole and carried aloft that heavy
stretch of wire.
</p>
<p>And there was less than twenty minutes in which
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
to work, to catch the Overland at Broken Gap. For
undoubtedly it was beyond that point that the bandits
planned holding her up&mdash;probably on one of the
steep grades of the Little Timber hills.
</p>
<p>Suddenly Alex uttered a gasp of hope. A moment
he debated, with nervously clasped hands, then, exhaustion
forgotten, dashed back into the little telegraph
room, found a screw-driver, and in a few minutes
had loosened from the table the telegraph-key
and the receiving instrument. Catching them up, with
some short ends of wire, he darted out and up the
track to the west.
</p>
<p>Two hundred yards distant the intact end of the
telegraph line drooped into the drainage ditch. Alex
caught it up and dragged it to the rails. Placing the
key and relay on the end of a tie, he connected them
on one side to the rail, and on the other side to the
end of the line wire.
</p>
<p>But the responding click did not come. Alex
groaned in disappointment. He had counted on the
rails giving a &#8220;ground&#8221; connection. Then the line
would have closed, and he could have worked it to
the west. But apparently the hot weather had entirely
dried out the sand beneath the rails, and thus insulated
them.
</p>
<p>But he was not yet beaten. There was a ground
wire at the station. Why could he not use the rails
that far, if they were insulated? With a hurrah he
seized the end of the line wire, and in a few moments
had connected it to one of the rail joints. Then, catching
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
up the instruments, he dashed back for the station.
</p>
<p>Placing the instruments again on the table, he found
a piece of loose wire that would reach from the instruments,
out through the window, to the rails; ran out
and quickly connected it to a rail joint, and, darting
back, connected the other end to the instruments. Instantly
there was a sharp downward click. The line
was closed!
</p>
<p>Alex could not suppress a quick &#8220;Thank Heaven!&#8221;
and, trembling with excitement, he seized the key and
began swiftly calling the despatcher. &#8220;X, X, X,
HC,&#8221; he called. &#8220;X, X&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>He felt the line open, and closed his own key. Then,
in surprise, he read: &#8220;So you have been monkeying
with the wires there after all, have you? Now look
here&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Quickly Alex interrupted, and shot back: &#8220;Train
robbers are after the Overland. They held me up,
and cut the wires both sides of the station. I got
free, and have made a connection through the rails&mdash;HC.&#8221;
</p>
<p>For a moment the line remained silent, while at his
end of the wire the despatcher sat bolt upright in his
chair, eyes and mouth wide open. But in another
moment the despatcher had recovered himself, and,
springing back to the key, began madly calling Broken
Gap.
</p>
<p>&#8220;B, B, B, X!&#8221; he called. &#8220;B, B, X! Qk! Qk!&#8221;
</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
<a name='linki_7' id='linki_7'></a>
<img src='images/illus-063.jpg' alt='' title='' /><br />
<p class='caption' style='text-align:center;'>
BUT THE RESPONSE CLICK DID NOT COME.
<br />
</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span></div>
<p>Alex shot a glance at the clock, and leaned forward
over the instruments, scarcely breathing. There was
yet three minutes before the Overland was due at
Broken Gap. But she did not stop there, and frequently
passed ahead of time. If &#8220;B&#8221; did not answer
the call immediately&mdash;
</p>
<p>The whir of &#8220;B&#8217;s&#8221; was interrupted, and slowly
and deliberately came an &#8220;I, I, B.&#8221; Alex leaped in
his chair, and again strained forward tensely.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Has 68 passed?&#8221; hurled the despatcher.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just coming.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop her! Flag her! Qk! Qk!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The line opened, as though &#8220;B&#8221; was about to make
a reply, then smartly closed again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop her! Stop her!&#8221; repeated &#8220;X.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was a leaden, breathless silence, while Alex
nervously clenched and unclenched his hands. At last
the line again clicked open, and with a characteristic
deliberation that caused the nerve-strung boy a moment&#8217;s
hysterical laugh, &#8220;B&#8221; announced: &#8220;Just got
her. She&#8217;s slowing in now. What&#8217;s up?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The despatcher at &#8220;X&#8221; had regained his equilibrium,
and in his usual crisp manner he replied: &#8220;Take
this for Conductor Bedford:
</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>&#8220;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Bedford</span>: Hold-up apparently planned between
Broken Gap and Hadley Corners. Probably on one
of the grades of the Little Timbers. Gather a posse
quickly, and make sure of capturing them. Report at
HC.
</p>
<div class='ra'>
<p style='text-align: right; '>&#8220;(Signed) <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Jordan</span>, X.&#8221;</p>
</div>

</div>
<div><span class='pagenum'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span></div>
<p>As &#8220;B&#8221; gave his &#8220;OK&#8221; with the stumbling hesitation
of blank astonishment, the line again opened.
And at the first word the intense strain broke, and
Alex sank forward over the table with a convulsive
sob.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Grand, my boy! Grand!&#8221; clicked the sounder.
It was his father, at Bixton. He had overheard it all.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Grand! That&#8217;s the word,&#8221; came the despatcher.
&#8220;There&#8217;s not another operator on the division who
would have known enough to do what he did to-day.
I guess we won&#8217;t bother him any more about his
&#8216;tinkering,&#8217; will we?&#8221;
</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Only half an hour late, the mighty mogul pulling
the Overland Limited drew panting to a stop before
the little station, and in a moment Alex was surrounded
by a crowd of congratulating trainmen and
passengers. And when he reappeared after sending
the message which notified the despatcher of the
train&#8217;s safe arrival and of the capture of the two bandits,
he was surprised and speechlessly confused by
having pressed upon him by the enthusiastic passengers
an impromptu purse of seventy-five dollars.
</p>
<p>Later in the afternoon Alex was called to the wire
by Jack, at Hammerton. &#8220;Say, what is all this you&#8217;ve
gone and done, Al?&#8221; clicked Jack enthusiastically.
&#8220;The afternoon papers here have a whole column
story! &#8216;Please attach statement at once!&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it looks much bigger than it really was,&#8221; responded
Alex modestly. &#8220;And anyway, it came about
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
through my own carelessness. I ought to have been
reprimanded, instead of patted on the back.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense! Those hold-up men would have got
you, anyway. If you had seen them coming, they
would simply have approached in a friendly way, then
got the drop on you. You had no gun.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But, say,&#8221; added Jack mock-seriously, &#8220;how is it
these real high class adventures always come your
way? I&#8217;m getting jealous.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can assure you you needn&#8217;t be. It&#8217;s lots more
fun reading about them. Wait and see,&#8221; said Alex.
</p>
<p>Jack was soon to have his opportunity of &#8220;seeing,&#8221;
though a more disagreeable experience was first to
come.

<h2>V</h2>
<h3>AN ELECTRICAL DETECTIVE</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Orr, Mr. Black wants you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jack, who was passing through the business
department of the Hammerton office, toward the stair
which led to the operating room, promptly turned
aside and entered the manager&#8217;s private room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good morning, Jack. Sit down.
</p>
<p>&#8220;My boy,&#8221; began the manager, &#8220;can you keep a
secret?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why yes, sir,&#8221; responded Jack, wondering.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well. But I must explain first. I suppose
you did not know it&mdash;we kept it quiet&mdash;but the
real reason Hansen, the janitor, was discharged a
month ago was that he was found taking money from
the safe here, which he had in some way learned to
open. After he left I changed the safe combination,
and thought the trouble was at an end.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Last Tuesday morning the cash was again a little
short. At the time I simply thought an error had
been made in counting the night before. This morning
a second ten-dollar bill is missing, and the cash-box
shows unmistakable signs of having been tampered
with.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now Johnson, the counter clerk, to whom I had
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
confided the new combination (for it is customary,
you know, that two shall be able to open a safe, as
a precaution against the combination being forgotten)&mdash;Johnson
is entirely above suspicion. Still, to make
doubly sure, I am going to alter the combination once
more, and share it with someone outside of the business
department. And as you have impressed me
very favorably, I have chosen you.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is, of course,&#8221; concluded the manager, &#8220;if
you have no objection.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly not. I am sure I appreciate the confidence,
sir,&#8221; said Jack quickly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well, then. The combination is &#8216;Right
twenty, twice; back nine; right ten.&#8217; Can you remember
that? For you must not write it down, you
know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jack repeated the number several times; and again
thanking the manager for the compliment, continued
up-stairs to the telegraph-room.
</p>
<p>Two mornings later Jack was again called into Mr.
Black&#8217;s office. For a moment, while Jack wondered,
the manager eyed him strangely, then asked, &#8220;What
was that combination, Jack?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Right ninety&mdash;no, right thirty&mdash;Why, I believe
I have forgotten it, sir,&#8221; declared Jack in confusion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps you have forgotten this too, then?&#8221; As
he spoke the manager took from his desk a small notebook.
&#8220;I found it on the floor in front of the safe
this morning.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is mine, sir. I must have dropped it last night.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
I worked extra until after midnight, sir,&#8221; explained
Jack, &#8220;and on the way out I chased a mouse in here
from the stairway, and when it ran under the safe
I dropped to my knees to find it. The book must have
fallen from my pocket.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But what is wrong, sir?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The cash-box is not in the safe this morning.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jack started back, the color fading from his cheeks
as the significance of it all came to him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And now you pretend to have the combination
entirely wrong,&#8221; went on the manager.
</p>
<p>Jack found his voice. &#8220;Mr. Black, you are mistaken!
You are mistaken! I never could do such
a thing! Never!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I would prefer proof,&#8221; Mr. Black said coldly.
</p>
<p>Jack caught at the idea. &#8220;Would you let me try
to prove it, sir? Will you give me a week in which
to try and clear myself?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I did not mean it that way. But, all right&mdash;a
week. And if things do not look different by
that time, and you still claim ignorance, you will have
to go. That is all there is to it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, sir.&#8221;
</p>
<p>At the door Jack turned back. &#8220;Mr. Black, you
are positive you returned the box to the safe?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Positive. It is the last thing I do before going
home.&#8221;
</p>
<p>During spare moments on his wire that morning
Jack debated the mystery from every side. Finally
he had boiled it down to two conflicting facts:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span></p>
<p>&#8220;First: That the box was placed in the safe the
night before, and in the morning was gone; and that,
besides the manager, he was the only one who could
have opened the safe and taken it. And,
</p>
<p>&#8220;Second: That, of course, he knew his own innocence.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The only alternative, then, was that Mr. Black had
been mistaken in thinking he had returned the box
to the safe.
</p>
<p>Grasping at this possibility, Jack argued on. How
could the manager have been mistaken? Overlooked
the box, say because of its being covered by something?
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why it may be there yet!&#8221; exclaimed Jack hopefully.
And a few minutes later, relieved from his
wire for lunch, he hurriedly descended again to the
manager&#8217;s office.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Black, may I look around here a bit?&#8221; he
requested.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Look around? What for?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;To see if I cannot find something to help solve
this mystery,&#8221; responded Jack, not wishing directly
to suggest that the manager had overlooked the box.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So you keep to it that you know nothing, eh?
Well, go ahead,&#8221; said the manager shortly, turning
back to his desk.
</p>
<p>Jack&#8217;s hopes were quickly shattered. Neither on
the desk, nor a table beside the safe, was there
anything which could have concealed the missing
box.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span></p>
<p>Stooping, he glanced under the table. Something
white, a newspaper, leaning against the wall, caught
his eye. With a flutter of hope he reached beneath
and threw it aside. There was nothing behind it.
</p>
<p>Disappointedly he caught the newspaper up and
tossed it into the waste-basket. Suddenly, on a
thought, he recovered the paper, and opened it. On
discovering it was the &#8220;Bulletin,&#8221; a paper he knew
Mr. Black seldom read, the idea took definite shape.
And, yes, it was of yesterday&#8217;s date!
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Black,&#8221; exclaimed Jack, &#8220;this is not your
paper, is it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Somewhat impatiently the manager glanced up.
&#8220;The &#8216;Bulletin&#8217;? No.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Were you reading it yesterday, sir?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t see what you are driving at&mdash;but,
no. It was probably left here by Smith, one of the
express clerks next door. He was in for a while yesterday
on some telegraph money-order business. Yes,
he did have it in his hand, now I remember. But
why?&#8221;
</p>
<p>At the mention of Smith&#8217;s name Jack started, and
there immediately came to him a remembrance of having
a few days previously seen the express clerk on a
street corner in earnest conversation with Hansen, the
discharged janitor.
</p>
<p>In suppressed excitement he asked, &#8220;When was
Smith here, Mr. Black? What time?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The manager smiled sardonically, and turned back
to his work. &#8220;No; you can&#8217;t fasten it on Smith,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
he said shortly. &#8220;It was after he went out that I
returned the box to the safe. But, if it&#8217;s any good
to you&mdash;he was in here from about five-thirty to ten
minutes to six, and was talking with one of the boys
in the outer office when I left.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And Mr. Black, were you outside during the time
Smith was in here?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I&mdash;Yes, I was, too. About a quarter to six
I was over at the speaking-tube for a minute.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But enough of this nonsense,&#8221; the manager added
sharply. &#8220;The box was in the safe when I closed it.
Don&#8217;t bother me any further with your pretense of
investigating. I don&#8217;t believe it is sincere.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Despite this cutting declaration Jack turned away
with secret satisfaction.
</p>
<p>Just outside the office door he made a second discovery&mdash;a
small one, but one which further strengthened
the theory he had formed.
</p>
<p>It was a small coal cinder and an ash stain in the
shape of a heel, apparently overlooked by a careless
sweeper.
</p>
<p>They could only have been left by a foot which came
from the cellar!
</p>
<p>Promptly Jack turned toward the cellar door, and
made his way down into the big basement.
</p>
<p>Going directly to one of the rear windows, he
carefully examined it. The cobwebs and the dust on
the sill had not been disturbed for months.
</p>
<p>He turned to the second, and instantly emitted a
shrill whistle of delight. Its cobwebs had been torn
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
and swept aside, and the ledge brushed almost clean.
And evidently but a short time before, for the cleared
space showed little of the dust which constantly filtered
through the floor above.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Fine!&#8221; exclaimed Jack. &#8220;Now I&mdash;&#8221; He
paused. The window was securely latched on the
inside!
</p>
<p>For several minutes Jack stood, disappointed and
mystified. Then, examining the latch closely, he
laughed, and grasping it with his fingers, easily pulled
it out. It had been forced from the outside, and
merely pressed back into the hole.
</p>
<p>But its being replaced showed that the intruder
had not made his escape that way.
</p>
<p>Jack began an examination of the end of the cellar
under the express office. And the exit was soon disclosed.
</p>
<p>The dividing wall was of boarding, and at the outer
end, to facilitate the examination of the gas metres
of the two companies, was a narrow door. Ordinarily
this door was secured on the telegraph company&#8217;s side
by a strong bolt.
</p>
<p>The bolt was drawn, and the door swung easily to
Jack&#8217;s touch!
</p>
<p>On the farther side all was darkness, however, and
Jack returned to the window. As he approached it
something on the floor beneath caught his eye. It
was a lead-pencil. He picked it up, and with a cry
of triumph discovered stamped upon it the initials and
miniature crest of the express company. And, more,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
a peculiar long-pointed sharpening promised the possibility
of fixing its actual owner.
</p>
<p>Filled with elation, and confident that it was now
only a matter of time when he should clear himself,
Jack hastened up-stairs, determined to pursue his investigation
next door, where he knew several of the
younger clerks.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, Danny,&#8221; he said, entering the express office,
and addressing a sandy-haired boy of his own
age. &#8220;Say, who in here sharpens pencils like this?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello! That? Oh, I&#8217;d know that whittle a mile
off. We call &#8217;em daggers&mdash;Smith&#8217;s daggers. Where
did you get it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Smith! Who wants Smith?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jack turned with a start. It was the clerk himself.
</p>
<p>Instantly Jack extended the pencil. &#8220;Is this yours,
Mr. Smith?&#8221; he asked, and held his breath.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it is. Where did you find&mdash;&#8221; Suddenly
the clerk turned upon Jack with a look of terror in
his face. But in a moment he had recovered himself,
and abruptly snatching the pencil from Jack&#8217;s hand,
proceeded to his desk.
</p>
<p>Jack was jubilant. Nothing could have been more
convincing of the clerk&#8217;s guilt. Following this feeling,
however, came one of pity for the unfortunate man;
and after a silent debate with himself, Jack followed
him.
</p>
<p>Placing a hand on the clerk&#8217;s shoulder, he said in
a low voice:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Smith, I have found out about that cash-box
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
of ours. Now look here, why not confess the wretched
business before it is too late, and&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>The clerk spun about. &#8220;Cash-box! Business!
What do you refer to?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Smith, it was you took our cash-box last
night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The clerk was colorless, but he only faltered an instant.
&#8220;What nonsense is this?&#8221; he demanded angrily.
&#8220;I never heard of your cash-box. What do
you mean by&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well then, I&#8217;ll tell you just how you did it,&#8221; said
Jack determinedly. &#8220;While you were in Mr. Black&#8217;s
office yesterday afternoon he stepped out and left you
alone for a moment. The cash-box was on the table.
You immediately saw the opportunity (perhaps Hansen
had done the same thing, and put you onto it?)&mdash;you
saw the opportunity, and threw over the box a
newspaper you had in your hand. As you had hoped,
not seeing the box, Mr. Black forgot it, and left at
six o&#8217;clock without returning it to the safe. You made
sure of that by remaining about the outer office until
he left. And then, after midnight you came down to
the office here, forced an entrance into our cellar, and
went up-stairs and secured the box.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry&mdash;but isn&#8217;t that so?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The clerk laughed drily. &#8220;The great Mr. Sherlock
Holmes, junior!&#8221; he remarked sarcastically. &#8220;Rubbish.
Run away and don&#8217;t bother me with your silly
detective theories,&#8221; and turned back to his desk.
</p>
<p>Jack stood, baffled and surprised.

THE CLERK WAS COLORLESS, BUT ONLY FALTERED AN INSTANT.
<br />
</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Look here, Orr!&#8221; As Smith again spun about
a hard look came into his face. &#8220;Look here, how do
you come to know so much about this business, yourself?
Eh?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jack uttered an exclamation, and a sudden fear of
the clerk came over him. Was Smith thinking of
trying to place the blame upon him?
</p>
<p>However, further discussion was clearly useless,
and he turned away.
</p>
<p>The following morning brought quick proof that
Jack&#8217;s suddenly inspired fear of Smith was too well
founded. As he entered the telegraph office Mr.
Black called him and handed him a note. &#8220;Now what
have you to say?&#8221; he demanded solemnly.
</p>
<p>In a lead-pencil scrawl Jack read:
</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Black: Your yung operatur Orr can tell you
sumthin about thet cash box, he was showin the key
of the box to sumone yesteday and i saw him. Mebee
you will finde the key in his offis cote.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yours, a frend.&#8221;
</p>
</div>
<p>&#8220;It is the key,&#8221; said the manager, producing a
small key on a ring. &#8220;I recall having left it in the
lock.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jack stood pale and speechless. Despite the disguised
writing and poor spelling, the letter was from
Smith, he had not a doubt. But how could he prove
it? Truly matters were beginning to look serious for
him.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span></p>
<p>Quickly, however, Jack&#8217;s natural spirit of fight-to-the-end
returned to him, and handing the letter back,
he said, respectfully but determinedly, &#8220;Mr. Black, I
still hold you to your promise to give me a week in
which to prove my innocence. And I&#8217;ll prove, too,
sir, that this key was placed in my pocket by someone
else, probably by the one who really took the box. I
believe I know who it is, but I&#8217;ll prove it first.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Reluctantly the manager consented, for he now
firmly believed at least in Jack&#8217;s complicity; and leaving
him, Jack sought the operating-room, to spend
every spare moment in turning the matter over in his
mind.
</p>
<p>What next could he do? If only he could find the
box! What would Smith probably have done with
it? For it seemed unlikely he would have taken it
away with him. Might he not, after removing the
money, have hidden it in the cellar? Jack determined
to search there; and accordingly, at noon, hastening
through his lunch, he descended and began a systematic
hunt amid the odds and ends filling the basement.
</p>
<p>The first noon-hour&#8217;s search brought no result.
The second day, returning to the task somewhat
dispiritedly, Jack began overhauling a pile of old
cross-pieces. There was a squeak, and a rat shot out.
</p>
<p>In a moment Jack was in hot pursuit with a stick.
The rat ran toward the old furnace, and disappeared.
At the spot an instant after, Jack found a hole in the
brick foundation, and thrust the stick into it. The
stick caught, he pulled, and several bricks fell out.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span></p>
<p>Dropping to his knees, Jack peered into the opening.
A cry broke from him, and thrusting in a hand he
grasped something, and drew it forth.
</p>
<p>It was the lost cash-box!
</p>
<p>Uttering a shout of triumph, Jack leaped to his feet
and started on a run for the stair. But suddenly he
halted. After all, was he absolutely sure it was Smith
who had placed it there? Would the producing of
the box prove it?
</p>
<p>The question, which had not before occurred to
Jack, startled him.
</p>
<p>As he stood thinking, half consciously he tried the
cover of the box. To his surprise it gave. He opened
it. And the box almost fell from his hands.
</p>
<p>It still contained the money! And apparently untouched!
</p>
<p>But in a moment Jack thought he understood.
Smith, or whoever it was, had left it as a clever means
of saving themselves from the worst in the event of
being found out, intending to return for it if the excitement
blew safely over.
</p>
<p>Then why not wait and catch them at it?
</p>
<p>Good. But how?
</p>
<p>Jack&#8217;s inventive genius soon furnished the answer.
&#8220;That&#8217;s it! Great!&#8221; he said to himself delightedly.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll get down and do it early in the morning. And
now I&#8217;ll stick this back in the hole and fix the bricks
up again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Seven o&#8217;clock the following morning found Jack
carrying out his plan. First conveying to the cellar
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
from the battery room two gravity-jars, he placed
them in a dark corner behind the furnace. Next, finding
an old lightning-arrester, he opened up the hiding-place,
and arranged the arrester beneath the cash-box
in such a way that on the box being moved the arrester
arm would be released, fly back, and make a contact.
Then, having carefully closed the opening, he procured
some fine insulated wire, and proceeded to make up
his circuit: From the arrester, out beneath the bricks,
around the furnace, to the battery; up the wall, and
through the floor by the steam-pipes into the business
office; and, running up-stairs and procuring a step-ladder,
on up the office wall, through the next floor,
into the operating room. And there a few minutes
later he had connected the wires to a call-bell on a
ledge immediately behind the table at which he worked.
And the alarm was complete.
</p>
<p>Although Jack knew that the clerk next door returned
from his dinner a half hour earlier than the
others in the express office, he had little expectation
of Smith visiting the cash-box at that time. Nevertheless,
as the noon-hour drew near he found himself
watching the alarm-bell with growing excitement.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There might be just a chance of Smith visiting
the box,&#8221; he told himself, &#8220;just to learn whether I
had&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>From behind him came a sharp &#8220;zip, zip,&#8221; then a
whirr. With a bound Jack was on his feet and rushing
for the door. Down the stairs he went, three
steps at a time, and into the manager&#8217;s private office.
</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
<a name='linki_9' id='linki_9'></a>
<img src='images/illus-083.jpg' alt='' title='' /><br />
<p class='caption' style='text-align:center;'>
&#8220;THERE!&#8221; SAID JACK, POINTING IN TRIUMPH.
<br />
</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Black,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;I&#8217;ve got the man who
took the box! Down the cellar! Quick!
</p>
<p>&#8220;I found the box, with the money still in it, and
fixed up an alarm-bell circuit to go off when he came
for it,&#8221; he explained hurriedly, as the manager stared.
In a moment Mr. Black was on his feet and hastening
after Jack toward the cellar stairway.
</p>
<p>Quietly they tiptoed down. They reached the bottom.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There!&#8221; Jack said, pointing in triumph. And
looking, the manager beheld Smith, the express clerk,
on his knees beside the furnace, before him on the
floor the missing cash-box.
</p>
<p>Ten minutes later the manager of the express company,
who had been called in, passed out of Mr.
Black&#8217;s office with his clerk in charge, and the telegraph
manager, turning to Jack, warmly shook his
hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am more sorry than I can say to have placed the
blame upon you, my boy,&#8221; he said sincerely. &#8220;And I
am very thankful for the clever way you cleared the
mystery up.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are quite a detective&mdash;sort of &#8216;electrical
detective&#8217;&mdash;aren&#8217;t you?&#8221; he added, smiling.
</p>
<p>And for some time, about the office, and even over
the wires, Jack went by that name&mdash;the &#8220;Electrical
Detective.&#8221;

<h2>VI</h2>
<h3>JACK HAS HIS ADVENTURE</h3>
</div>

<p>One afternoon a few days following the affair
of the missing cash-box Manager Black appeared
in the Hammerton operating room, and after
a consultation with the chief operator, called Jack
Orr from his wire.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Jack,&#8221; said the manager, &#8220;there have been some
important developments in the big will case on trial
out at Oakton, and the &#8216;Daily Star&#8217; has asked for
a fast operator to send in their story to-night. The
chief tells me you have developed into a rapid sender.
Would you care to go?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d be glad of the opportunity, sir,&#8221; said Jack,
delightedly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right. The chief will let you off now, so you
will have plenty of time to catch the seven o&#8217;clock train.
And now, Jack, do your best, for the &#8216;Morning Bulletin&#8217;
is sending its news matter in by the other telegraph
company, and we don&#8217;t want them to get ahead
of us in any way.&#8221;
</p>
<p>When Jack reached the station, several of the newspaper
men, including West of the &#8220;Star,&#8221; already
were there. Among them he saw Raub, a reporter
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
of the &#8220;Bulletin,&#8221; and with him Simpson, an operator
of the opposition telegraph company.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, hello, kid!&#8221; said the latter on seeing Jack.
&#8220;They are not sending you out to Oakton, are
they?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They are,&#8221; responded Jack, with pride. Simpson
laughed, and, somewhat indignant, Jack passed on
down the platform. On turning back, he noticed
Simpson and Raub apart, talking earnestly. As he
again neared them, both glanced toward him, and abruptly
the conversation ceased. At once Jack&#8217;s suspicions
were aroused, for he knew Raub had the name
of being very unscrupulous in news-getting matters,
and that Simpson was not much better. He determined
to watch them.
</p>
<p>But nothing further attracted his attention, and
finally, the train arriving, they boarded it, and made
a quick run of the ten miles to the little village. There
Jack headed for the local telegraph office.
</p>
<p>He found it a tiny affair, in a small coal office on
the southern outskirts of the village. Introducing
himself to the elderly lady operator, who was just
leaving, he went to the key and announced his arrival
to the chief at Hammerton.
</p>
<p>It was an hour later when West, the &#8220;Star&#8221; reporter,
appeared. &#8220;Here you are, youngster,&#8221; said
he; &#8220;a thousand words for a starter. It&#8217;s going to
be a great story. I&#8217;ll be back in half an hour with
another batch.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Promptly Jack called &#8220;H,&#8221; and soon was clicking
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
away in full swing. But suddenly the instruments
ceased to respond. The wire had &#8220;opened.&#8221; Jack
tested with his earth connection, and finding the opening
was to the south, waited, thinking the receiving
operator at Hammerton had opened his key. But
minute after minute passed, and finally becoming anxious,
he cut off the southern end and began calling
&#8220;B,&#8221; the terminal office to the north.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I, I,&#8221; said B.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Get H on another wire and ask him what is wrong
here,&#8221; Jack sent quickly. &#8220;We are being held up on
some very important stuff.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;H says it is open north of him,&#8221; announced B,
returning. &#8220;We are putting in a set of repeaters here,
so you can reach him this way.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A moment later Jack heard Hammerton calling
him from the north, and in another moment he was
again sending rapidly.
</p>
<p>But scarcely had Jack sent a hundred words when
this wire also suddenly failed. When several minutes
again passed and no further sound came, Jack leaned
back in despair. Suddenly he sat upright. Raub and
Simpson! Was it possible this was their work? Was
it possible they had cut the wires?
</p>
<p>Quickly he made a test which would show whether
the breaks were near him. Adjusting the relay-magnets
near the armature, he clicked the key. There
was not the faintest response. Switching the instruments
to the southern end of the wire, he repeated the
test, with the same result.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span></p>
<p>On both ends the break was within a short distance
of him. Undoubtedly the wires had been cut!
</p>
<p>Jack sprang to his feet and seized his hat. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
find that southern break if I have to walk half-way to
Hammerton,&#8221; he said determinedly, and leaving the
office, set off down the moonlit road, his eyes fixed
on the wire overhead.
</p>
<p>Scarcely a mile distant Jack uttered an exclamation,
and, running forward, caught up the severed end of
the telegraph line.
</p>
<p>A moment&#8217;s examination of the wire showed it had
been cut through with a sharp file.
</p>
<p>Yes; undoubtedly it was the work of Raub and
Simpson, in an effort to keep the news from the
&#8220;Star,&#8221; and score a &#8220;beat&#8221; for the opposition telegraph
company and the &#8220;Morning Bulletin.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But you haven&#8217;t done it yet,&#8221; said Jack grimly,
turning to look about him. How could he overcome
the break in the wire? As the cut had been made
close to the glass insulator on the cross-arm, only one
of the two ends hung to the ground, and he saw that
he could not splice them. And in any case he could
not climb the pole and take that heavy stretch of wire
with him.
</p>
<p>His eyes fell on a barb-wire fence bordering the
road, and like an inspiration Alex Ward&#8217;s feat with
the rails at Hadley Corners occurred to him. Could
he not do the same thing with one of the fence wires?
Connect this end of the telegraph line (and fortunately
it was the Hammerton end), say to the upper strand,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
then run back to the office and string a wire from the
fence in to the instruments?
</p>
<p>To think was to act. Dragging the telegraph wire
to the fence, Jack looped it over the topmost strand
near one of the posts, and wound it about several
times, to ensure a good contact. Then on the run he
started back for the telegraph office.
</p>
<p>As he neared the little building Jack saw a figure
within. Thinking the &#8220;Star&#8221; reporter had returned
with further copy, he quickened his steps. At the
doorway he halted in consternation. Instead of the
reporter were two desperate-looking characters, and
on the table beside them a half-emptied bottle and a
large revolver.
</p>
<p>Jack hesitated a moment, then stepped inside.
&#8220;What are you men doing here?&#8221; he demanded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, hello, kiddo! We are the new operators,&#8221;
said one of them with tipsy humor. &#8220;You&#8217;re discharged,
see? And you git, too!&#8221; he suddenly
shouted, catching up the pistol. And promptly Jack
&#8220;got.&#8221; A few yards distant, however, he halted.
Now what was he to do?
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh here you are, eh? Where have you been?&#8221;
It was West, the &#8220;Star&#8221; man, and he spoke angrily.
&#8220;I was here ten minutes ago, and found the office
empty, and if the other company could have handled
my stuff yours would have lost it. I&#8217;ve just
been&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Interrupting, Jack hastily explained, telling of the
severed wire, and his plan to bridge the break. The
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
reporter uttered an indignant exclamation. &#8220;It&#8217;s
Raub&#8217;s work, sure as you&#8217;re born,&#8221; he said hotly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But say, youngster, we can&#8217;t permit ourselves to
be beaten this way. Can&#8217;t we do something?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We might get some help, and drive the roughs
out,&#8221; suggested Jack.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; we haven&#8217;t time. And then they might put
up a drunken fight and shoot somebody. Come, think
of something else. You surely can get over this new
difficulty, after your clever idea for getting around
the cut in the wire.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; replied Jack doubtfully, glancing
toward the office window. &#8220;If there was any way of
getting the instruments&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What could you do with them?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We could turn the barn there into an office. I&#8217;d
run connections out through the back to the fence.
It&#8217;s just behind.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Say&mdash;I&#8217;ve an idea then! If it wouldn&#8217;t take you
long to remove the instruments from the table?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Only a couple of minutes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on,&#8221; said West. Leading the way back
toward the office, he explained, &#8220;I&#8217;ll get these beggars
out, you hide round the corner, and soon as the
way is clear rush in and get your instruments, and
duck for the barn. I&#8217;ll join you later.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How are you going to get them out?&#8221; whispered
Jack.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Watch,&#8221; said the reporter.
</p>
<p>As Jack drew out of sight about the rear of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
building his mystification was added to when he saw
West pause before the door, stoop and pick up a handful
of gravel. But immediately the reporter entered
the doorway and spoke his purpose was explained.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, you two big rummies,&#8221; he said in his most
offensive tones. &#8220;What are you doing here?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The two men were in a momentarily genial mood,
however, and missed the insult. &#8220;Why, hello pard,
ol&#8217; man,&#8221; responded one of them cordially. &#8220;Come
in an&#8217; make &#8217;self t&#8217; home. Wanta buy a telegraph
office? Cheap?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Cheap! You are the cheapest article I see here,&#8221;
replied West, yet more insultingly. &#8220;What do you
mean by sitting down in respectable chairs? You
ought to be tied up in a cow-stable. That&#8217;s where
you belong.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was an angry growl as the two men scrambled
to their feet, and peering about the corner Jack
saw West back into the door.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on out, you big, overgrown cowards,&#8221;
shouted the reporter. &#8220;I&#8217;ll thrash the both of you,
with one hand tied behind me!
</p>
<p>&#8220;And take that!&#8221;
</p>
<p>With his last words West suddenly threw the gravel
full in the faces of the now enraged men, and spinning
about, raced off down the road. They stumbled
forth, shouting with rage, and one of them fired.
The bullet went yards wide, and West ran on. Without
further wait Jack darted into the office, in a few
minutes had the relay and key from the table, secured
some spare ends of wire for connections, and sped for
the barn.
</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>

<p class='caption' style='text-align:center;'>
LOOPED IT OVER THE TOPMOST STRAND, NEAR ONE OF THE POSTS.
<br />
</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span></div>
<p>There all was darkness. Entering, a search with
matches soon produced a lantern, however. Lighting
it, Jack stepped without to discover whether its glimmer
could be seen from the direction of the office. As
he closed the door West appeared, panting and laughing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what do you think of that stunt, youngster?&#8221;
he chuckled. &#8220;Did you get the instruments?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. I was out here to learn whether the light of
a lantern I found could be seen.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good head! No; it doesn&#8217;t show.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And come on! Here the beggars are again!&#8221;
West led the way inside, and closed the door behind
them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now what, my boy?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A table first. Here, the very thing,&#8221; said Jack,
making towards a long feed-box at the rear of the
barn.
</p>
<p>As they cleared its top of a pile of harness West
asked, &#8220;Just what is the scheme here, youngster? I
don&#8217;t think I understand it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, simple enough. I&#8217;ll just run the wires out
through that knot-hole, and connect one to the fence
and the other to the ground.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Simple! It looks different to me,&#8221; declared the
reporter admiringly. &#8220;All right, go ahead. I&#8217;ll get
down on this box and grind out the rest of my story.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Already Jack was at work sorting over the odd
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
pieces of wire he had brought. Finding two suitable
lengths, and straightening them out, he quickly connected
them to the instruments, placed the instruments
in a convenient position on the top of the box, and
thrust the wire ends through the knot-hole. Then,
hastening outside to the rear of the barn, he proceeded
to connect one of them to the same strand of the fence
wire to which the telegraph line was secured a mile
distant. The other he drove deep into the damp earth
beneath the edge of the building. And, theoretically,
the circuit was complete.
</p>
<p>Hurriedly he re-entered the barn to learn the result.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; said West anxiously.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There is current, but it&#8217;s too weak.&#8221; Jack&#8217;s voice
quavered with his disappointment. &#8220;I suppose the
rusty splices of that old fence offer too much resistance.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;m not beaten yet,&#8221; he exclaimed, suddenly
recovering his determination. Turning from the box,
he began pacing up and down the floor. &#8220;I&#8217;ll figure
it out somehow if I&mdash;oh!&#8221; With the cry Jack darted
for the door, out, and toward the office.
</p>
<p>The intoxicated roughs were again in possession.
Quietly he made his way to a dark window adjoining
the lighted window of the operating room&mdash;the
window of a little store-room, where, the local operator
had told him, the batteries were located.
</p>
<p>The window was unlocked, and with little difficulty
he succeeded in raising it. Cautiously he climbed
within, and feeling about, found the row of glass jars.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
Quickly disconnecting two of them, he carried them
to the window-sill, clambered out, and hastened with
them to the barn.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now I&#8217;ve got it, Mr. West!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
have H again in fifteen minutes!&#8221;
</p>
<p>West started to his feet. &#8220;Can&#8217;t I help you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right. Come on,&#8221; said Jack. And ten minutes
later, working like beavers, they had transferred
to the barn the entire office battery of twenty cells.
</p>
<p>In nervous haste Jack connected the cells in series,
then to the wire. Instantly the instrument closed with
a solid click.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurrah! We win! We win!&#8221; cried West, and
Jack, springing to the key, whirled off a succession of
H&#8217;s. &#8220;H, H, H, ON! Rush! H, H&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I, I, H! Where have you been? What&#8217;s the
matter?&#8221; It was the chief, and the words came
sharply and angrily.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The wire was cut both sides of the village,&#8221; shot
back Jack. &#8220;I think it was Raub and Simpson&#8217;s work.
And two roughs chased me out of the office with a
revolver. Hired by them, I suppose. I&#8217;ve fixed up
an office in the barn, and am sending for a mile
through a wire fence, to bridge the cut. <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Orr</span>.&#8221;
</p>
<p>For a moment the chief was too amazed to reply.
Then rapidly he said: &#8220;Orr, you are a trump! But
come ahead with that report now. And make the
best time you ever made in your life. I&#8217;ll copy you
myself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And there, in a corner of the big barn, by the dim
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
light of the lantern, and to the strange accompaniment
of munching cattle and restlessly stamping horses,
West wrote as though his life depended upon it, and
Jack sent as he had never sent before. And exactly
an hour later the young operator sent &#8220;30&#8221; (the
end) to one of the speediest feats of press work on
that year&#8217;s records of the Hammerton office.
</p>
<p>Though it was 3 <span style='font-variant: small-caps'>A. M.</span> when Jack got back to Hammerton,
he found the chief operator at the station to
meet him. &#8220;I had to come down, to congratulate
you,&#8221; said the chief. &#8220;That was one of the brightest
bits of work all-round that I&#8217;ve heard of for years.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But did we beat them?&#8221; asked Jack.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We assuredly did. For didn&#8217;t you know?
Those two roughs later went up and cleaned out the
other office&mdash;the very men who had hired them to
disable us! And what with having had a slow-working
wire previously, the &#8216;Bulletin&#8217; didn&#8217;t get in more
than five hundred words. We gave the &#8216;Star&#8217; over
three solid columns.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The manager&#8217;s congratulation the following morning
was as enthusiastic as that of the chief. &#8220;And
as a practical appreciation, Jack,&#8221; he added, &#8220;we are
going to give you a full month&#8217;s vacation, with salary.
We think you earned it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>When Jack returned to his wire one of the first
remarks he heard was from Alex Ward, at Bixton.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, old boy,&#8221; clicked Alex, &#8220;your adventure
came, didn&#8217;t it. And it has me beaten to a standstill.&#8221;
</p>

HAD NEVER SENT BEFORE.

</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense. It was your stunt at Hadley Corners
that suggested the trick that got me out of it,&#8221; declared
Jack. &#8220;But say, the manager has given me
a month&#8217;s vacation. What do you think of that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He did! Look here,&#8221; sent Alex quickly, &#8220;come
to Bixton and spend some of it with me. I&#8217;ll promise
you all kinds of a good time. Though I am not sure
I can guarantee anything as exciting as last night&#8217;s
work,&#8221; he added.
</p>
<p>Jack readily accepted the invitation. And, as it
turned out, Alex might as well have made his promise.
He could have kept it.

<h2>VII</h2>
<h3>A RACE THROUGH THE FLAMES</h3>
</div>

<p>The fall had been an exceptionally dry one in that
section of the middle west, and in consequence
several forest fires had occurred, several not far from
Bixton. Thus, when a few mornings following Jack&#8217;s
arrival he and Alex proposed a visit to the old house
in the woods where Alex had had his thrilling experience
with the foreign trackmen, Mrs. Ward objected.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You know there was a fire but five miles west
yesterday, Alex,&#8221; she said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But that was only in the grass along the track,
Mother, and the section-men soon had it out. They
are watching everywhere. And on the first sign of
smoke we will light for home like good fellows&mdash;won&#8217;t
we, Jack?&#8221; he promised. Somewhat reluctantly
Mrs. Ward finally consented, and gave the boys
a lunch, and they set off to make a day of it.
</p>
<p>Paying a visit first to the abandoned brick-yard, it
was noon when Jack and Alex emerged from the
woods at the rear of the deserted old cabin.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So that&#8217;s it!&#8221; exclaimed Jack with keen interest
as they went forward. &#8220;And up there is the very
door you dropped from, I suppose?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, that is it. Still half open, too&mdash;just as I
left it. And over there is the barn and cow-stable.
But let us have lunch first, and I&#8217;ll explain everything
afterward,&#8221; Alex said, leading the way toward the
house. &#8220;I am as hollow as a bass-drum.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Ten minutes later, sitting on the cabin floor just
within the doorway, eating and chatting, the two boys
became suddenly silent, and sniffed at the air. With
an exclamation both leaped to their feet, and to the
door.
</p>
<p>Rolling from the trees at the southern border of
the clearing was a white bank of smoke. The woods
were on fire!
</p>
<p>&#8220;Which way?&#8221; cried Jack, as they sprang forth.
&#8220;The railroad?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Alex darted to the corner of the house and glanced
about. &#8220;No! The wind has swung to the southwest!
We&#8217;d never make it! North, for the brick-yard!
Come on!
</p>
<p>&#8220;If we are cornered there, we can swim the river,&#8221;
he explained as they ran. &#8220;The fire isn&#8217;t likely to
cross the water.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They reached the trees, and immediately found
themselves in a madly frightened procession. At their
feet scurried rabbits, squirrels, chipmunks. A fox
flashed by within a yard of them. Overhead, birds
screamed and called in terror.
</p>
<p>On they dashed, and a ghostly yellow light began
to envelop them. &#8220;The smoke overhead,&#8221; said Alex.
&#8220;It will soon be down here, too.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I smell it,&#8221; panted Jack a moment later. Soon
they began to feel it in their eyes.
</p>
<p>Jack began to lag. &#8220;How much farther, Alex?&#8221;
he gasped.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Only a short distance, now. Yes, here we are,&#8221;
announced Alex, as brighter light appeared ahead of
them. A moment after they broke into the clearing.
</p>
<p>Without slackening pace Alex headed for the old
semaphore. &#8220;From up there we can see just how we
stand,&#8221; he explained. Almost exhausted, they
reached it, and Alex ran up the ladder. Scrambling
onto the little platform, he turned toward the river,
two hundred yards distant. A cry broke from him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We are cut off! The fire has crossed the
river!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jack hastily clambered up beside him, and above
the tree-tops beyond the river he beheld a gray-white
cloud.
</p>
<p>The boys gazed at one another with paling faces.
&#8220;What shall we do?&#8221; asked Jack.
</p>
<p>Alex shook his head. &#8220;We might swim the river,
and try a dash for it. It is two miles out of the woods,
but there might be a chance.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We couldn&#8217;t do it. We&#8217;re too nearly exhausted.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How about staying right in the river, by the
bank?&#8221; Jack suggested. &#8220;I&#8217;ve heard of people doing
that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is too deep here, and it&#8217;s awfully cold. We
would chill and cramp in no time.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; I tell you,&#8221; went on Alex suddenly. &#8220;We&#8217;ll
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
try one of the old tile ovens on the other side of the
yard. Perhaps we can box ourselves up in one of
them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was no time to lose, for the clearing was now
blue with smoke, and climbing hastily to the ground,
the boys were again off on the run. They reached the
group of round-topped ovens.
</p>
<p>A glance showed that their hope was futile. All
about the furnaces were thickets of dead weeds, and
a short distance away, and directly to windward, was
a huge pile of light brushwood.
</p>
<p>Promptly Alex turned back. &#8220;We would be
smothered or roasted in five minutes,&#8221; he declared.
&#8220;No. It is the water, or nothing. Perhaps we can
work it by floating on a log.&#8221;
</p>
<p>As they approached the river, the boys crossed the
old yard siding. Stumbling over the rails, partially
blinded with the now stinging smoke, both suddenly
ran into something, and fell in a heap. Scrambling
to their feet, they found an old push-car, with low
sides.
</p>
<p>Alex uttered a cry. &#8220;Jack, why can&#8217;t we make a
dash down the spur with this old car&mdash;pushing it?
And say, couldn&#8217;t we lift it onto the main-line rails,
and run all the way home?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jack hesitated. &#8220;Look there,&#8221; he said, pointing to
the wall of smoke into which the track disappeared a
hundred yards away. &#8220;And wouldn&#8217;t there be
burned-down trees across the rails?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; not yet. The fire hasn&#8217;t been burning long
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
enough. And as to the smoke, it&#8217;ll soon be just as
bad on the river,&#8221; Alex declared.
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right. Let us try it. But first, let us jump
in the river and get good and wet,&#8221; suggested Jack.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good idea! Come on!
</p>
<p>&#8220;Or; wait!&#8221; exclaimed Alex. &#8220;Another idea.
There is an old rubbish pile just over here, and a lot
of tin cans. Let us get some, and fill them with water&mdash;to
keep our handkerchiefs wet, to breathe through.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They turned aside, quickly found and secured several
empty cans each, and ran on. Reaching the water,
they dropped the cans on the bank, and plunged in
bodily.
</p>
<p>As Alex had said, the water was intensely cold, and
despite the relief to their eyes from the smoke, they
clambered out again immediately, hastily filled the
tins, and only pausing to tie their dripping handkerchiefs
over their mouths, dashed back for the siding.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You help me start her, Jack,&#8221; directed Alex as
they placed the cans of water in the forward end of
the car, &#8220;and when we reach the edge of the woods,
jump in. I&#8217;ll run it the first spell, then you can relieve
me. That way we can keep it going at a good
clip.
</p>
<p>&#8220;All ready? Let her go!&#8221; With bowed heads
they threw themselves against the little car, the rusty
wheels began to screech; rapidly they gained headway,
and soon were on the run.
</p>
<p>They neared the smoke-hidden border of the clearing.
</p>

<p class='caption' style='text-align:center;'>
WITH A RUSH THEY DASHED INTO THE WALL OF SMOKE.
<br />
</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Jump in, Jack!&#8221; cried Alex. Jack sprang over
the tail-board and threw himself flat on his face,
and with a rush they dashed into the wall of
smoke.
</p>
<p>Rumbling and screeching, the car sped onward.
Alex began to feel the heat. Suddenly it swept over
them like the breath of a furnace, and there came a
mighty roar.
</p>
<p>They were in the midst of the flames.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you all right, Alex?&#8221; cried Jack.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221; A moment later, however, Alex too sprang
into the car, as he did so tearing off his handkerchief
and stuffing it into one of the water-cans. &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t
have held on another minute,&#8221; he choked. &#8220;I believe
the handkerchief was burning.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jack prepared to climb out to take Alex&#8217;s place.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No! Lay still!&#8221; interposed Alex. &#8220;The car will
run by itself here. There&#8217;s a down grade.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jack dropped back thankfully. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it awful,&#8221;
he gasped. &#8220;My eyes are paining as though they
would burst.&#8221;
</p>
<p>On rushed the car down the roaring, crackling tunnel
of flames, groaning and screeching like a mad
thing. Tongues of fire began to lick over the sides
of the car at the cringing boys within.
</p>
<p>Faster the car went. Presently it began to rock.
&#8220;She&#8217;ll be off the track!&#8221; cried Jack at last.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lie farther over!&#8221; directed Alex above the roar,
himself moving in the opposite direction. The rearrangement
steadied the car slightly, but still it rocked
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
and plunged on the long unused track so that at times
the boys&#8217; hearts leaped into their throats.
</p>
<p>The heat was now terrific. The floor and sides of
the car began to blister and crack.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t stand it much longer! We&#8217;ll be
cooked!&#8221; coughed Jack.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Empty one of the cans over your head,&#8221; Alex
shouted. &#8220;Keep up a few minutes longer, and we will
be over the worst. It is the leaves and brush that are
making the heat, and we&#8217;ll soon be where they have
burned out.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we are over the worst of it now,&#8221; he announced
a moment later. &#8220;There&#8217;s not so much
crackling; and I don&#8217;t think it is so hot.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Simultaneously the car began to leap less wildly,
then perceptibly to slow up. Alex at once prepared
to climb out again. &#8220;I&#8217;ll give her another run,&#8221; he
said. But promptly Jack pressed him back. &#8220;No you
don&#8217;t! I&#8217;m going to take my turn.&#8221; And in another
moment he was out in the full glare of the still shrivelling
heat, rushing the car on at the top of his speed.
A hundred yards he drove it, and scrambled back
within, gasping for breath. Emptying one of the remaining
cans over Jack&#8217;s head, Alex sprang out and
took his place.
</p>
<p>A moment after, they struck a slight up grade.
Alex uttered a joyful shout. &#8220;Only a short run farther,
Jack, and we&#8217;re out of the woods!&#8221;
</p>
<p>But immediately he followed this glad announcement
with one of new alarm.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The washout! I&#8217;d forgotten it! It&#8217;s just ahead!
The rails there almost hang in the air!&#8221;
</p>
<p>In a panic Alex slowed up. Jack climbed out beside
him. &#8220;Let us rush it,&#8221; he suggested. &#8220;The rails
may hold&mdash;like a bridge. We&#8217;re not heavy. And
we may as well take one more chance.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Alex debated. &#8220;All right! Come on! And jump
quick when I say! I think I can tell when we are
near it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Once more the car was flying onward through the
haze.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here we come! <i>Now!</i>&#8221;
</p>
<p>With a bound Jack was back in the car. Alex made
a final rush, and sprang after. The car dipped forward
and sideways, a breathless instant seemed to
hang in mid-air, then righted, and shot forward
smoothly. Uttering a hoarse shout of joy, the boys
leaped out, and were again running the car ahead,
and a moment later gave vent to a second and louder
cry.
</p>
<p>In their faces blew the cooler air of a clearing.
</p>
<p>A few yards farther they halted.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t see a thing. Can&#8217;t open them,&#8221; declared
Jack, as they stood rubbing their eyes, and recovering
their breath.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Neither can I. Give me your hand, and we&#8217;ll
soon fix it. There is a path here down to the water.&#8221;
Feeling with his foot, Alex found it, and pulling Jack
after, hastened down, and in another moment both
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
were on their stomachs on the river-bank, their faces
deep in the cooling water.
</p>
<p>Ten minutes later, greatly revived, but with faces
and hands intensely smarting from their burns, the
boys replenished the cans of water&mdash;for they still had
a two miles&#8217; run through the smother of smoke&mdash;and
lifted the car onto the main-line rails.
</p>
<p>As they did so, from far to the west came a whistle.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A train! Can&#8217;t we stop her?&#8221; suggested Jack.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;d never see us in the smoke.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, say, let us throw the old car across the
tracks, so they&#8217;ll strike it. They would probably stop
to see what it was.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It might derail her. No. I&#8217;ve got it. Come on,
and get the car started so she&#8217;ll cross the bridge, and
I&#8217;ll explain.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said Jack, as they rolled out on the
trestle.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You remember the steep grade just over the
bridge? Well, we&#8217;ll stop about fifty yards this side,
wait till the train whistles the last crossing, then hit
it up for all we are worth, and&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And let the train catch us?&#8221; cried Jack. &#8220;But,
gracious! won&#8217;t that be taking an awful chance?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, for she won&#8217;t be going very fast, on account
of the curve at the bottom, and we&#8217;ll be going like a
house afire,&#8221; declared Alex, confidently. &#8220;And when
she bunts us, we&#8217;ll jump for her cow-catcher, and five
minutes later we&#8217;ll be out in the glorious fresh air
again.&#8221;
</p>

<br />
</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Well, all right. If you are willing to take the risk,
I am,&#8221; said Jack.
</p>
<p>They reached the spot designated by Alex, and
brought the car to a stand.
</p>
<p>Again came the whistle of the train. &#8220;Ready!&#8221;
cried Alex. &#8220;The next time!&#8221;
</p>
<p>It came. Like sprinters they threw themselves at
the car, and in a few strides were racing down the
rails at full speed; reached the head of the grade, and
sprang over the tail-board just as the train rumbled
onto the bridge.
</p>
<p>Downward they shot, gaining momentum at every
turn of the wheels.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Whe-ew! But we&#8217;re taking an awful chance,&#8221;
said Jack, nervously.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No. Listen to her brakes,&#8221; said Alex.
</p>
<p>Despite his assurance, when, a moment later, the
great engine suddenly appeared out of the smoke and
came thundering down upon them, Alex faltered, and,
with Jack, nervously clutched the sides of the little car.
But dashing on unrestrained, they yet further increased
their mad speed, and for a few seconds seemed
even to be holding their own with the mighty mogul.
</p>
<p>Then the great engine began eating up the distance
between them, and the boys gathered themselves together
for the supreme moment.
</p>
<p>Closer came the roaring monster. &#8220;Now, don&#8217;t
jump,&#8221; cautioned Alex, who had regained his nerve.
&#8220;Wait until she is just going to hit us, then fall forward
and grab the brace&mdash;that rod there.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Here she comes! Ready! <i>Now!</i>&#8221;
</p>
<p>With a jolt the engine hit the car, and in an instant
the boys fell forward, grasped a smoke-box brace, and
in another moment had scrambled to the top of the
cow-catcher.
</p>
<p>And they were safe!
</p>
<p>When, ten minutes later, the train came to a standstill
at Bixton, the engineer suddenly felt his hair rise
on end as two wildly unkempt and blackened figures
appeared slowly dismounting from the front of his
engine, and stumbled across the station platform.
But the shout of joy which greeted them told they
were no ghosts.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Although I think we weren&#8217;t far from it, were
we, Jack?&#8221; said Alex, at home a few minutes after,
when his mother made a similar comparison.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope I&#8217;ll not be as near it again for a long time
to come,&#8221; said Jack, earnestly.

<h2>VIII</h2>
<h3>THE SECRET TELEGRAM</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Alex, will you work for me three or four hours
to-night?&#8221; requested the Bixton night operator
of Alex one evening late in October. &#8220;I have
just had an invitation to a surprise party at Brodies&#8217;,
and wouldn&#8217;t care to miss it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Alex agreed willingly. &#8220;I&#8217;ll be right in line then
for the latest news of the chase,&#8221; he declared. For
an attempt had been made that morning to rob the
Farmers&#8217; Savings Bank at Zeisler, a posse had been
sent from Bixton to aid in the pursuit of the robbers,
and reports from the hunt were being anxiously
looked for.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Take care you don&#8217;t get in line for any bullets,&#8221;
laughed the operator as he left. &#8220;It&#8217;s your weakness,
you know, to get mixed up in any excitement that&#8217;s
going on within a mile of you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>To Alex&#8217;s disappointment hour after hour passed,
however, and brought no further word, either of the
pursued, or the pursuers. Finally, just before midnight,
hearing Zeisler &#8220;come in&#8221; on the wire to report
the passing of a freight, Alex reached for the
key, determined to inquire.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span></p>
<p>As he did so footsteps sounded on the silent platform
without, the waiting-room door opened, and two
strangers appeared at the ticket-window. Glancing
in, they turned to the office door, and entered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, youngster,&#8221; said the taller of the two,
cordially, leaning over the parcel-counter. &#8220;What&#8217;s
the news from the man-hunt?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was going to ask Zeisler just as you came in,&#8221;
replied Alex, turning again to the key.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, never mind, then. Just tell them they were
captured here, instead.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What! Captured here?&#8221; exclaimed Alex.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it. About an hour ago, just north, by
the Bloomsbury posse. Sheriff O&#8217;Brien sent us down
with the news, so you could send word up and down
the line and call in the other posses. No need of them
plugging around all night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But, instead of complying, Alex suddenly turned
more fully toward the two men. &#8220;What posse did
you say you were with?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Bloomsbury! Bloomsbury!&#8221; said the smaller
man, impatiently.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Bloomsbury! Don&#8217;t you mean Bloomsburg?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what thundering difference&mdash;&#8221; The taller
man flashed a warning gesture, and in an instant Alex
understood.
</p>
<p><i>He was face to face with the bank robbers themselves!</i>
</p>
<p>For a moment he stared from one to the other in
consternation. Then, sharply recovering himself, he
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
turned quickly back to the key. But he was too late.
He had betrayed his discovery.
</p>
<p>Both men laughed. &#8220;Your surmise is correct, my
young friend,&#8221; said the taller man, lightly. &#8220;We
are the gentlemen who were forced to leave Zeisler
so hurriedly this morning.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But don&#8217;t let that make any difference,&#8221; he continued,
producing a revolver and placing it significantly
on the counter before him. &#8220;Go right ahead
with the message.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Or wait, give me a blank, and I&#8217;ll write it, so you
will be sure to have it right.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, hold on,&#8221; interposed his companion. &#8220;Now
that he knows who we are, how do you know he will
send the message as you write it, and not just the other
thing&mdash;give us away?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The first speaker threw down his pen. &#8220;Well, I&#8217;m
an idiot. That&#8217;s so.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He thought a moment, then, turning toward Alex,
eyed him sharply an instant, and said: &#8220;Youngster,
I&#8217;ll give you a dollar a word if you will give me your
solemn promise to send this message just as I write
it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A bare instant Alex hesitated, while the tempter
whispered that it would mean thirty or forty dollars
for a few minutes&#8217; work, and that everyone would
take it for granted he had been compelled to send it.
Then abruptly he leaned back in his chair and shook
his head. &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t do it,&#8221; he said quietly but
positively.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you couldn&#8217;t, eh, Goody-goody?&#8221; exclaimed
the smaller man, with a snarl, catching up the revolver
and pointing it at Alex&#8217;s head. &#8220;Now could you do
it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The taller man caught his arm. &#8220;Don&#8217;t be a fool,
Jake. After all, we couldn&#8217;t be sure he wasn&#8217;t fooling
us even if he took the money.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Look here, I have a scheme.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They stepped back and spoke together in low tones
for a moment; then the taller turned again to Alex,
who meantime had remained quiet in his chair, futilely
endeavoring to think of some means of spreading the
alarm.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose you are not the only operator at this
station, kid?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; there is a day and a night operator. I am
only &#8216;subbing&#8217; for the night man,&#8221; responded Alex,
wondering.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is he?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;At a party.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is the day man?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;At his boarding-house. But you couldn&#8217;t
get either of them to do it,&#8221; Alex declared confidently,
thinking he had caught the drift of their
purpose.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind what we could or what we couldn&#8217;t.
Where does the day operator board? Is it far?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Momentarily Alex had a mind to refuse to tell;
then, on the thought that suspicion might be aroused
if one of the robbers went to rout the day man out,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
he replied, &#8220;About a quarter of a mile,&#8221; and described
how the house could be reached.
</p>
<p>Again the two men held a whispered consultation,
and at its conclusion the smaller man hurriedly left.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now I suppose you are wondering what we propose
doing with the day operator,&#8221; said the tall man,
with a grin, when they were alone. &#8220;Well, it&#8217;s so
good I think I&#8217;ll tell you. One of the cleverest getaway
schemes you ever heard of, and my own idea.
Can you guess?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Alex shook his head. &#8220;If it&#8217;s not to send the
message&mdash;and which I know he won&#8217;t&mdash;I don&#8217;t
know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The robber laughed. &#8220;You are going to send the
message, and he is going to stand just outside the
door here and tell us letter by letter just what you
make the instruments say. See?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Alex uttered an exclamation. And, strange as it
may seem, it was not entirely of chagrin, for the
striking originality and ingenuity of the plan immediately
appealed to his own peculiar genius for getting
over difficulties.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And then,&#8221; continued the talkative safe-breaker,
&#8220;we will tie you both in your chairs, cut the wires,
then flag the night express, and depart for the East
like respectable citizens, and by the time you have
been found and the wires restored we will be well out
of danger.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, I claim there is some class to that scheme.
What?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span></p>
<p>Despite himself, Alex could not forbear a smile,
even while he at once saw that to defeat the plan would
be almost an impossibility. Nevertheless, as the bank
robber turned his attention to a time-table, Alex determinedly
addressed his wits to the problem.
</p>
<p>Presently, as he sat looking at the telegraph instruments
for an inspiration, he started. That last
First of April joke he had played on his father! The
cut-off arrangement of wires was still in place beneath
the instrument table! Could he not use it?
</p>
<p>He determined to see whether the connections were
still in order. Fortunately he was sitting close to the
table, with his feet beneath. Making a move as
though tired of his position, he crossed one foot over
the other, and sank a little lower in the chair. Then,
the change having brought no comment from the man
at the counter, he carefully reached out the upper foot,
found the two wires and pressed them together. Immediately
came a click from the instruments.
</p>
<p>It was in working order! With hope Alex at once
addressed himself to its possibilities, and soon a suggestion
came. &#8220;Yes, I believe I could do it,&#8221; he told
himself with satisfaction. &#8220;I&#8217;ll make a try anyway.
So much for never giving up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>At that moment the footfalls of the returning robber
and those of another sounded on the platform
without. Both men were talking, and as they entered
the waiting-room Alex heard the evidently still unsuspecting
Jones say: &#8220;Funny, though. I never heard
of the boy being troubled with his heart before.&#8221;
</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
<a name='linki_14' id='linki_14'></a>
<img src='images/illus-123.jpg' alt='' title='' /><br />
<p class='caption' style='text-align:center;'>
&#8220;COME ON! COME ON!&#8221; EXCLAIMED THE MAN IN THE<br />
DOORWAY.
<br />
</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span></div>
<p>The next moment Jones&#8217;s casual tones changed to
a sharp cry of fright, and Alex knew that the robber
had revealed himself. &#8220;Now you keep your tongue
between your teeth, and do exactly what you are told,
young man, or you get this! You understand?
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now turn about&mdash;your back toward the office
door&mdash;so.&#8221; The door was flung open, and the robber
appeared standing sideways, his gun in his hand,
pointing at the day operator, who was just out of
Alex&#8217;s sight.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now what you are to do is to read off letter by
letter what this young shaver in here sends on the
wire. You are a tab on him. You understand?&#8221;
</p>
<p>In a trembling voice Jones responded in the affirmative.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And the first one of you who appears to do anything
not straight and aboveboard gets daylight
through his head,&#8221; he added, raising his voice for
Alex&#8217;s benefit. Then, addressing his partner, he said:
&#8220;Give the kid the message, Bill.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The tall man leaned over the counter and tossed the
blank on the table before Alex.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who will I send it to first?&#8221; asked Alex.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The sheriff, Watson Siding.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right. But first, you know, I have to call
him,&#8221; explained Alex, somewhat nervously, now that
the critical moment had come. &#8220;His call is WS.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Therewith he began slowly calling, that Jones might
read off each letter as he sent it, &#8220;WS, WS, WS,
BX.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span></p>
<p>&#8220;WS, WS&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I, I,&#8221; answered WS.
</p>
<p>&#8220;WS answers,&#8221; interpreted Jones.
</p>
<p>Steadying himself with a deep breath, Alex proceeded
to carry out his plan. Carefully reaching forth
with his foot beneath the table, he pressed the two
wires together, then loudly clicked his key. The instruments,
thus &#8220;cut out,&#8221; of course failed to respond.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The wire appears to have opened,&#8221; announced
Jones. &#8220;Probably the man at WS has opened his
key while getting a blank or a pen.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Again Alex clicked the key as though in a futile
effort to send, then leaving it open, thus holding the
instruments on the table &#8220;dead,&#8221; began ticking his
foot against the impromptu key beneath the table.
</p>
<p>And while the instruments at Bixton remained
momentarily silent, the surprised operator at Watson
Siding read in draggy but decipherable signals the
words:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Read every other word.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on! Come on!&#8221; exclaimed the man in the
doorway, turning suspiciously. Immediately Alex
withdrew his foot and closed the key, and at the resulting
audible click Jones announced: &#8220;The wire has
closed. He can send now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right. Come ahead,&#8221; commanded the short
man, impatiently.
</p>
<p>Then very deliberately, with a pause after each
word, seemingly to enable Jones to interpret, but really
to give himself time to send another word, unheard,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
beneath the table, Alex sent on the key, and Jones
read aloud, the following message:
</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>&#8220;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Sheriff</span>,
</p>
<p>&#8220;Watson Siding:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Safe-blowers have been captured near here. Call
in your posse.
</p>
<div class='ra'>
<p style='text-align: right; '>&#8220;(Signed)  O&#8217;Brien,</p>
<p style='text-align: right; '>&#8220;Sheriff Quigg County.&#8221;</p>
</div>

</div>
<p>What the at first puzzled and then thunderstruck
operator at Watson Siding read off his instrument ran
very differently. It read:
</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>&#8220;Safe THEY blowers ARE have HERE been IN
captured STATION near INTEND here. GOING
call OUT in BY your NIGHT posse. EXPRESS.
</p>
<p>&#8220;(Signed)  &#8217;PHONE O&#8217;Brien,
&#8220;BACK Sheriff HERE Quigg QUICK County.&#8221;
</p>
</div>
<p>A moment after giving his &#8220;OK&#8221; the Watson
Siding operator was at the telephone calling for Bixton
central.
</p>
<p>Meantime, having thus sent the message to WS
to the bank-breakers&#8217; satisfaction, Alex proceeded to
call and send it by turns to Zeisler, Hammerton, and
other stations on the line. Sending slowly, to make
the most of his time, it was within fifteen minutes of
the hour the express was due when Alex had sent the
last of the messages.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Now you can step in and see your friend,&#8221; said
the man in the doorway, addressing Jones, who appeared,
white and trembling, and coming behind the
counter, dropped into a chair facing Alex. The
speaker then once more disappeared, and presently an
opening click of the instruments told the nature of his
errand. The wires had been cut.
</p>
<p>He soon returned, and rummaging about, while the
taller man stood guard over them, he found some
ropes, and proceeded to bind Alex and the day operator
tightly in their chairs.
</p>
<p>Just as the task was completed there came a long-drawn
whistle from the west. Both robbers promptly
turned to the door. &#8220;Well, good night, gentlemen,&#8221;
said the smaller, grimly. &#8220;Much obliged for your
kind services.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And I would just pause to repeat,&#8221; said the taller,
jocosely, &#8220;that there is some class to this getaway
scheme, should any one ask you. Good night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Yes, there is class&mdash;but it isn&#8217;t first!</i>&#8221;
</p>
<p>Uttering a cry the two bank robbers staggered back
from the door, and with a bound the deputy sheriff
and a constable were upon them, bore them to the
floor, and after a brief but terrific struggle disarmed
and handcuffed them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the sheriff, rising, and with his knife
quickly freeing the two prisoners, &#8220;there was class
to it, but it was <i>second</i>.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Our young friend here takes &#8216;<i>first</i>.&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<div class='figcenter'>

<p class='caption' style='text-align:center;'>
&#8220;HOW DID YOU DO IT, SMARTY?&#8221; SNAPPED THE SHORTER MAN.
<br />
</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span></div>
<p>The robbers turned upon Alex with furiously flashing eyes.
&#8220;How did you do it, smarty?&#8221; snapped the shorter man.
</p>
<p>Alex laughed, kicked one foot beneath the table, and
the instrument responded with a click. &#8220;A little First
of April trick. What do you think of it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Whatever the two renegades might have said
through their gritting teeth, there was no doubt as to
what the sheriff and the others thought. Nor the bank
officials at Zeisler, when, a day later, there came to
Alex a highly commendatory letter and a check for
two hundred dollars.
</p>
<p>But better even than this, in Alex&#8217;s estimation, a
few mornings after the chief despatcher called him to
the wire and announced his appointment as night operator
at Foothills, a small town on the western division.

<h2>IX</h2>
<h3>JACK PLAYS REPORTER, WITH UNEXPECTED RESULTS</h3>
</div>

<p>Not long after Alex left Bixton to take up his
duties at Foothills, Jack, at Hammerton, also
received an advancement. In itself it was not of particular
note, beyond an encouraging increase in salary,
and a transfer from the day to the night force; but
indirectly it resulted in an experience more thrilling
than any Jack&#8217;s genius for tackling adventurous difficulties
had yet brought him.
</p>
<p>Wheeling by the office of the &#8220;Daily Star&#8221; one
afternoon, he heard his name called, and turned his
head to discover West, the reporter with whom he
had made the memorable Oakton trip, hastening after
him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just the man I was looking for, Jack,&#8221; declared
West, as the young operator wheeled to the curb. &#8220;I
have a job for you.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How would you like to tackle a bit of Black Hand
investigation?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jack laughed. &#8220;You don&#8217;t mean it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I certainly do. It&#8217;s this way,&#8221; went on the reporter,
lowering his voice. &#8220;A Black Hand letter demanding
money was received last week by Tommy
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
Spanelli, of the Italian restaurant. It was mailed
here; and we have the tip that last evening two
foreigners were seen stealing across the old quarry
turnpike, and into the woods, as though not wishing
to be seen. Of course they may not be connected with
this at all, but again they may; and I was put on the
job to find out. The difficulty is that I am too well
known. If they caught sight of me, they would be
suspicious immediately.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But they would never suspect a lad like you,&#8221;
West proceeded; &#8220;and I know you could carry anything
through that came along. So will you run out
there and investigate for me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, certainly. But just what shall I do?&#8221; Jack
asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wheel up and down the quarry turnpike for an
hour or so, then, if you have seen no one, beat around
through the woods as far as the old stone quarry.
And any foreigners you come upon, take a good look
at. That&#8217;s all. And drop in at the office here in the
morning, and report.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s easy. All right,&#8221; agreed Jack readily.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you. And keep the matter quiet, you
know,&#8221; West added. &#8220;We want an exclusive story
for the &#8216;Star&#8217; if anything comes of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand. And, say,&#8221; said Jack as he turned
away, &#8220;I&#8217;ll take my camera, too. I may be able to
get a snap of them, if I see anyone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good idea. A picture would help to land them,
if they are the fellows we want; and we could run
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
it in the paper with our story. Go ahead, Jack, and
good luck.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jack was not long in wheeling home and securing
his folding Brownie; and a half hour later found him
pedalling slowly along the quarry road near the point
several miles from the city where the suspicious foreigners
had been seen to enter the woods.
</p>
<p>An hour passed, however, and he had seen no
doubtful characters, and finally dismounting at the entrance
to a path he knew to lead toward the old stone
quarry, Jack concealed his wheel in a thicket, and set
off to make an investigation in that direction.
</p>
<p>A moment after he came to a halt with a sharp
exclamation. In the path at his feet lay a murderous-looking
stiletto. Picking it up, he examined it. Yes;
it was of foreign make. And the still damp mud
stains on the side of the blade which had lain uppermost
showed it had been but recently dropped.
</p>
<p>Apprehensively Jack cast a glance about him, almost
immediately to utter a second suppressed exclamation.
Emerging from the woods on the opposite side of
the road was a short, dark man&mdash;undoubtedly an
Italian.
</p>
<p>With beating heart Jack watched him. Was he one
of the men he was looking for?
</p>
<p>In the middle of the road the stranger halted, looked
sharply to right and left, and came quickly forward.
Darting from the path Jack threw himself on the
ground behind a bush, and the next moment the man
hurriedly passed him. He was soon out of sight, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
rising, Jack placed the dagger carefully in an inside
pocket, and determinedly set off after.
</p>
<p>Half a mile he followed the Italian amid the trees.
Then there appeared the light of an opening, and going
forward more carefully, Jack found himself on the
edge of the quarry clearing. The foreigner was hurrying
along the brink of the excavation, evidently
heading for a small tumble-down cabin at its farther
end.
</p>
<p>The man reached the shanty, and knocked. To
Jack&#8217;s surprise the door was opened by a negro.
</p>
<p>Wonder at this was quickly forgotten, however, for
as the door closed from the woods behind Jack came
the sound of voices, then an ejaculation in Italian. A
moment Jack stood, in consternation, believing he had
been seen. But a glance showed that the owners of
the voices were yet out of sight beyond a rise, and
recalling his wits, Jack ran for a nearby clump of
elders.
</p>
<p>The voices came quickly nearer. Suddenly then,
for the first time Jack recalled the camera. At once
came the suggestion to get a snap of the newcomers as
they stepped into the clearing.
</p>
<p>Jack glanced about him. A short distance away,
and but a few feet from the path, was a low, tent-like
spruce. With instant decision he made for it, drawing
the camera from his pocket as he ran.
</p>
<p>Dropping to his knees, he wormed his way beneath
the tree, and through to the opposite side. Finding an
aperture commanding the exit of the path, he opened
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
and focused the camera upon it. The next moment
the two Italians appeared. For the fraction of a second
Jack hesitated, fearing the click of the shutter
might betray him. But he took the chance, there was
a crisp, low click&mdash;and he had them, and they had
passed on.
</p>
<p>Chuckling with delight, Jack crept forth. What
next? Looking toward the shanty, he again saw the
door opened by the negro. This decided him. Replacing
the camera in his pocket, he set off on a circuit
through the trees that would bring him back to
the clearing immediately opposite the shanty, determined
if possible to reach it, and learn what was going
on inside.
</p>
<p>Without incident he made the point desired, and
gazing from the cover of a bush, discovered with satisfaction
that the two hundred yards separating him
from his goal was dotted with small bushy spruce.
More important still, on that side of the cabin were
no windows.
</p>
<p>Stooping, Jack was about to steal forth, when he
paused with a new idea. It came from a stray piece
of wrapping-paper lying on the ground before him.
</p>
<p>Why couldn&#8217;t he conceal the camera in this paper,
with a string tied to the shutter; approach the house,
knock, ask some question, and secretly snap whoever
opened the door?
</p>
<p>To think was to decide, and at once he set about
preparations. Finding some cord in a pocket, he first
deadened the click of the shutter with a thread of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
string, and secured a piece of it to the shutter trigger.
Carefully then he wrapped the camera, open, in the
paper, and with his knife cut a small hole opposite the
lens, and a second and smaller hole beneath. Through
the latter he fished out the trigger-string&mdash;and the
detective camera was complete.
</p>
<p>Without delay Jack adjusted the parcel under his
arm, holding the trigger-string in his fingers, and
strode boldly forward toward the shanty. He reached
it, approached the door, and knocked. From within
came the sound of voices, then a heavy step. Drawing
the string taut Jack moved back several paces, and
pointed the opening in the package at the door.
</p>
<p>But success was not to come too easily. The latch
lifted, and the door opened only a few inches, barely
showing the eyes and flat nose of the negro.
</p>
<p>&#8220;W&#8217;at yo&#8217; want?&#8221; he demanded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you please tell me the way out to the
road?&#8221; said Jack steadily.
</p>
<p>The negro regarded him sharply a moment, then
opening the door barely sufficient to reach out a hand,
pointed toward the woods, and said gruffly, &#8220;Yo&#8217; see
dat broke tree? Right out dah.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Which one? I see two,&#8221; declared Jack, coolly.
</p>
<p>Impatiently the negro threw the door wide, stepped
out, and pointed again. In an instant Jack had pulled
the string, and from the parcel had come a soft
&#8220;thugk!&#8221; &#8220;Thank you, sir,&#8221; said Jack, turning
away, and inwardly chuckling at the double meaning
of the words. &#8220;Thank you.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But look aheah, boy,&#8221; added the colored man
threateningly, &#8220;doan yo&#8217; be prowlin&#8217; roun&#8217; heah!
Un&#8217;stan&#8217;?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No fear. I&#8217;ll be glad when I&#8217;m away,&#8221; responded
Jack, again secretly laughing, and headed for the
woods, the negro watching him until he was half way
across the clearing.
</p>
<p>Once more in the shelter of the trees, Jack determined
to follow up his success by endeavoring to
discover just what was taking place at the cabin. Hiding
the camera in a convenient brush-heap, he made
sure all was quiet, and again stole forth. Slipping
quickly from shrub to shrub, he safely made the crossing,
and came to a halt at the rear of the shanty.
</p>
<p>To his ears came the sound of voices in subdued
discussion. They were so muffled, however, that he
could distinguish nothing, and recalling a partly open
window at the front, he went forward to the corner,
peered cautiously about, and tiptoed to within a few
feet of it.
</p>
<p>At once the voices came to him plainly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You gotta dat?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Stan&#8217; in doo&#8217;way, hat in yo&#8217; han&#8217;, upside down,&#8221;
responded the colored man&#8217;s gruff voice.
</p>
<p>Wondering, Jack drew nearer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;At halfa da past two by da beeg clock,&#8221; continued
the first speaker.
</p>
<p>There was a pause, and the negro repeated, &#8220;At
half pas&#8217; two by dah city clock, shahp.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Suddenly it came to Jack. At the dictation of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
Italian, the negro was writing a &#8220;Black Hand&#8221; letter&mdash;ordering
one of their victims to display some signal
to show that the demand for money would be complied
with!
</p>
<p>The Italian&#8217;s next sentence left no further doubt.
&#8220;If you no giva da sign, you deada man by seex
clock.&#8221;
</p>
<p>At the words, and the fierceness with which they
were uttered, Jack felt a chill run up his spine. Had
he followed his immediate impulse he would have
fled. But determining to learn if possible who the
letter was for, he waited.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What numbah?&#8221; asked the negro.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Feefity-nine Main.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Italian restaurant! Another letter to Spanelli!
The men he was after!
</p>
<p>Jack waited to hear no more, but tiptoeing back
about the corner, was off for the woods, jubilant at
his success.
</p>
<p>Indeed Jack was over jubilant&mdash;so jubilant that he
forgot the necessity of caution, made a short cut across
an open space in full view of the shanty, and half
way was brought to a sudden realization of his
mistake by the creak of an opening door. In consternation
he at once saw he could not reach cover
before being seen, and also that did he run, the
Black-Handers would understand they had been discovered.
</p>
<p>With quick presence of mind he recognized and
instantly did the one thing possible. Turning, he
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
headed back boldly for the cabin. The next instant the
three Italians came into view, immediately discovered
him, and halted. Secretly trembling, but with a cool
front, Jack approached them as they stood, excitedly
whispering.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you kindly tell me the time?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>The three men exchanged glances, then, as at a
signal, stepped forward and surrounded him. &#8220;Now,
whata you want?&#8221; demanded one of them sharply,
thrusting his dark face close to Jack&#8217;s. Before Jack
could repeat his question the shanty door opened and
the negro appeared. Exclaiming angrily, he ran
toward them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;W&#8217;at he want? W&#8217;at he want now?&#8221; he demanded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He say, whata da time,&#8221; repeated one of the
Italians.
</p>
<p>&#8220;W&#8217;at de time? He am a spy! A spy!&#8221; cried the
negro. &#8220;In de house with him!&#8221; Jack sprang back,
and turned to run. With a rush the negro and one
of the foreigners were upon him, and despite his terrified
struggles he was dragged bodily into the shanty.
There they flung him heavily into a chair, and gathered
menacingly about him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now boy, w&#8217;at yo&#8217; spyin&#8217; roun&#8217; heah fo&#8217;? Eh?&#8221;
demanded the negro fiercely.
</p>
<p>Instinctively Jack opened his lips to deny the charge,
but closed them, and remained in dogged silence.
Despite his peril, he felt he could not tell a deliberate
falsehood. The negro repeated the question.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I simply asked them the time,&#8221; said Jack evasively.
</p>
<p>With a snarl one of the foreigners caught him by
the shoulders and yanked him upright. &#8220;Tie heem!&#8221;
he directed, and roughly two of the others drew
Jack&#8217;s hands behind him, and bound them with a cord.
As one of the Italians then proceeded to tie a handkerchief
about his ankles, Jack barely suppressed a cry
of fright. But grimly he clenched his teeth, and not
a sound escaped him as the negro then caught him up,
carried him across the room, kicked open a door, and
threw him upon the floor within.
</p>
<p>For a few minutes Jack lay dazed, then turning on
his side, he looked about him. By the dim light of
a dusty window he saw he was in a small, roughly
furnished bedroom. Before he had taken in further
particulars, however, a sound of heated discussion in
the outer room drew his attention.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no! We can&#8217;t taka da chance!&#8221; came the
voice of one of the Italians. &#8220;Not wid dat boy!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Filled anew with terror Jack struggled to a sitting
position and began straining desperately at his bonds.
A moment&#8217;s effort caused his heart to sink. The knots
were as taut as though made of wire.
</p>
<p>Determinedly he continued to strain and pull, however,
and presently, losing his balance, he rolled over
on his side, and something hard pressed into his
chest.
</p>
<p>The dagger he had picked up! Quickly he saw the
possibility of using it. Working again into a sitting
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
position, he bent low and sought to reach inside his
coat and seize the hilt of the knife with his teeth. But
as often as he reached, the coat swung, and the hilt
evaded him.
</p>
<p>Jack was not to be beaten, however. Getting to his
knees, he bent far over, until his head almost touched
the floor, and fell vigorously to shaking himself. At
the second effort the dagger slipped out to the floor.
Quickly then he got a firm hold on the end of the
handle with his teeth, struggled again to a sitting
position, drew his knees up as far as possible, and
bending low between them, began stabbing at the
handkerchief about his ankles with the point of the
weapon.
</p>
<p>At the first attempt the knife barely touched the
handkerchief. He tried again, and just reached it.
Throwing his head far back, to gain momentum, he
lunged forward with all his strength. The keen point
struck the linen squarely, there was a rip and tear&mdash;and
his feet were free.
</p>
<p>As the severed handkerchief fell from his ankles,
the dagger, slipping from Jack&#8217;s teeth, clattered to the
floor. But the noisy discussion still going on without
prevented its being heard; and promptly Jack turned
to the problem of freeing his hands.
</p>
<p>As they were tied behind him, this promised to be
far more difficult. Indeed Jack&#8217;s courage was beginning
to fail him, when the method of freeing his
ankles suggested a possibility. At once he essayed it.
Rising to a kneeling position, he strained at his wrists
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
for several minutes, then, bending far over, began
working his hands down beneath him.
</p>
<p>It seemed as though they would never come, and
again and again he had to pause for breath. Desperately
he continued, and suddenly at last they slipped,
and were under him, directly below his knees.
</p>
<p>Throwing himself over on his side, he once more
grasped the dagger hilt in his teeth, and as he lay,
carefully aimed the point between his legs at the cord
about his wrists, and gave a quick, hard thrust. At
the first blow he struck the cord fairly, but only half
severed the strand. Again he lunged, and the next
moment he was free.
</p>
<p>The heated debate was still in progress in the outer
room, and nearly exhausted though he was, Jack immediately
scrambled to his feet and tiptoed to the
window. To his joy he discovered it was made of a
sliding frame, only fastened by a loosely-driven nail.
It required but a few minutes&#8217; work to remove this,
and very cautiously he began sliding the window
back.
</p>
<p>Half way it went easily, without noise. Then it
stuck. Carefully Jack put his shoulder to it. Suddenly,
without warning, it gave, then stopped with a
jar, and to his horror a broken pane shot from the
frame and fell clattering to the floor.
</p>
<p>From the other room came a shout and a rush of
feet. In desperation Jack stepped back, and with a
run fairly dove at the opening. His head and shoulders
passed through, then he stuck. Behind him the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
door flew open. With a desperate wriggle he struggled
through, and fell in a heap to the ground just as
the negro reached the window and made a wild lunge
for him. The next moment Jack was on his feet and
off across the clearing like a hare.
</p>
<p>The four lawbreakers were quickly out of the house
in full chase. Presently there was the report of a
pistol, and a shrill &#8220;wheeeu&#8221; just over Jack&#8217;s head.
Ducking instinctively, but with grimly set lips, he
rushed on. Again came the whine of a bullet, and
again. With a final sprint Jack reached the cover of
the woods in safety, darted to the brush-pile and recovered
his camera, and on, straight through the trees
for the spot at which he had hidden his wheel.
</p>
<p>Love of outdoor life and sports now stood Jack in
good stead. Despite the exhausting efforts of his escape,
and the hard running amid the trees, over trunks
and through undergrowth, he kept on at the top of his
speed, and finally reached the road ahead of the nearest
of his pursuers.
</p>
<p>Rushing for his wheel, he dragged it forth, and
quickly had it on the road. Not a moment too soon.
As he sprang into the saddle there was a shout and a
crash of bushes but a few feet from him. But throwing
all his weight on the pedals, he shot away, and
a moment after sped about a bend in the road&mdash;and
was safe.
</p>
<p>Jack would not have been a real boy had there not
been considerable pride in his voice when, entering
the &#8220;Star&#8221; office the following morning, he handed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
West, the reporter, two small photographs, neatly
mounted, and said:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here are the pictures, Mr. West.&#8221;
</p>
<p>West sprang to his feet. &#8220;No! Great! Splendid!&#8221;
he cried. &#8220;How did you do it, Jack?
</p>
<p>&#8220;But here&mdash;&#8221; Pushing Jack into a chair, he
dropped back into his own, and caught up a pencil.
&#8220;Give me the whole story, from beginning to end. If
the police round up these fellows this morning we will
run it in to-day&#8217;s edition.&#8221;
</p>
<p>This, with the aid of Jack&#8217;s snap-shots, the police
did, capturing the entire band; and that afternoon&#8217;s
edition of the &#8220;Star&#8221; carried a two-column story of
Jack&#8217;s adventure with the Black-Handers, which, with
the pictures, made what West declared &#8220;the biggest
story of a month of Sundays.&#8221;

<h2>X</h2>
<h3>A RUNAWAY TRAIN</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Hurry in, Ward, or the lamp will be out!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Alex, who had now been night operator at
Foothills six months, closed the station door behind
him, and laughingly flicked his rain-soaked cap toward
the day operator, whom he had just come to relieve.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it raining that hard? You look like a drowned
rat for sure,&#8221; said Saunders as he reached for his hat
and coat. &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you stay at home, and &#8217;phone
down? I would have been glad to work for you&mdash;not.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait until you are out in it, and you&#8217;ll not
laugh,&#8221; declared Alex, struggling out of his dripping
ulster. &#8220;It is the worst storm this spring.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And wait until you see the fun you are going to
have with the wire to-night, and you&#8217;ll not indulge
in an over-abundance of smiles. I haven&#8217;t had a dot
from the despatcher since six o&#8217;clock. Had to get
clearance for Nineteen around by MQ, and now we&#8217;ve
lost them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There is someone now,&#8221; said Alex, as the instruments
began clicking.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s somebody west. IC, I think. Yes; Indian
Canyon,&#8221; said Saunders, pausing as he turned to the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
door. &#8220;What is he after? He certainly can&#8217;t make
himself heard by X if we can&#8217;t.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;X, X, X,&#8221; rapidly repeated the sounder, calling
Exeter, the despatching office. &#8220;X, X, X! Qk!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Alex and Saunders looked at one another with a
start. Several times the operator at Indian Canyon
repeated the call, more urgently, then as hurriedly
began calling Imken, the next station east of him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There must be something wrong,&#8221; declared Alex,
stepping to the instrument table. Saunders followed
him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;IM, IM, IC, Qk! Qk!&#8221; clicked the sounder.
</p>
<p>&#8220;IM, IM&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I, I, IM,&#8221; came the response, and the two operators
at Foothills listened closely.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A wild string of loaded ore cars just passed here,&#8221;
buzzed the instruments. &#8220;Were going forty miles an
hour. They&#8217;ll be down there in no time. If there&#8217;s
anything on the main line get it off. I can&#8217;t raise X
for orders.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The two listening operators exchanged glances of
alarm, and anxiously awaited Imken&#8217;s response. For
a moment the sounder made a succession of inarticulate
dots, then ticked excitedly, &#8220;Yes, yes! OK!
OK!&#8221; and closed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What did he mean by that?&#8221; asked Saunders
beneath his breath. &#8220;That there was something on
the main track there?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps a switch engine cutting out ore empties.
We&#8217;ll know in a minute.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span></p>
<p>The wire again snapped open, and whirred, &#8220;I got
it off&mdash;the yard engine! Just in time! Here they
come now! Like thunder!
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&mdash;they&#8217;re by! Are ten of them. All
loaded. Going like an avalanche. Lucky thing the
yard engine was&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sharply the operator at Indian Canyon broke in to
hurriedly call Terryville, the next station east.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But the runaways won&#8217;t pass Terryville, will
they?&#8221; Alex exclaimed. &#8220;Won&#8217;t the grades between
there and Imken pull them up?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Saunders shook his head. &#8220;Ten loaded ore cars
travelling at that rate would climb those grades.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then they will be down here&mdash;and in twenty or
thirty minutes! And there&#8217;s the Accommodation
coming from the east,&#8221; said Alex rapidly, &#8220;and we
can&#8217;t reach anyone to stop her!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Saunders stared. &#8220;That&#8217;s so. I&#8217;d forgotten her.
But what can we do?&#8221; he demanded helplessly.
</p>
<p>Terryville answered, and in strained silence they
awaited his report. &#8220;Yes, they are coming. I
thought it was thunder.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here they are now,&#8221; he added an instant after.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re past!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll reach us! What shall we do?&#8221; gasped
Saunders.
</p>
<p>Alex turned from the table, and as the Indian Canyon
operator hastily called Jakes Creek, the last station
intervening, began striding up and down the
room, thinking rapidly.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span></p>
<p>If they only had more battery&mdash;could make the
current in the wire stronger! Immediately on the
thought came remembrance of the emergency battery
he had made the previous year at Watson Siding. He
spun about toward the office water-cooler. But only
to utter an exclamation of disappointment. This
cooler was of tin&mdash;of course useless for such a purpose.
</p>
<p>Hurriedly he began casting about for a substitute.
&#8220;Billy, think of something we can make a big battery
jar of!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;To strengthen the wire!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A battery? But what would we do for bluestone?
I used the last yesterday!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Alex returned to the table, and threw himself hopelessly
into the chair.
</p>
<p>At the moment the Jakes Creek operator answered
his call, and received the message of warning.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Say,&#8221; said Saunders, &#8220;perhaps some of the other
fellows on the wire have bluestone and the other stuff,
and could make a battery!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Alex uttered a shout. &#8220;That&#8217;s it!&#8221; he cried, and
springing to the telegraph key, as soon as the wire
closed, called Indian Canyon. &#8220;Have you any extra
battery material there?&#8221; he sent quickly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No. Why&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Abruptly Alex cut him off and called Imken. He
also responded in the negative. But from Terryville
came a prompt &#8220;Yes. Why&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you one of those big stoneware water-coolers
there?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but wh&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know how to make a battery?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, listen&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>The instruments had suddenly failed to respond. A
minute passed, and another. Five went by, and Alex
sank back in the chair in despair. Undoubtedly the
storm had broken the wire somewhere.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything against us!&#8221; he declared bitterly.
&#8220;And the runaways will be down here now in fifteen
or twenty minutes. What can we do?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t think of anything but throwing the west
switch,&#8221; said Saunders. &#8220;And loaded, and going at
the speed they are, they&#8217;ll make a mess of everything
on the siding. But that&#8217;s the only way I can think
of stopping them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If there was any way a fellow could get aboard
the runaways&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Alex broke off sharply. Would it not be possible
to board the runaway train as he and Jack had boarded
the engine on the day of the forest fire? Say, from a
hand-car?
</p>
<p>He started to his feet. &#8220;Billy, get me a lantern,
quick!
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going for the section-boss, and see if we can&#8217;t
board the runaways from the hand-car,&#8221; he explained
as he caught up and began struggling into his coat.
&#8220;I did that once at Bixton&mdash;boarded an engine.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Board it! How?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Run ahead of it, and let it catch us.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span></p>
<p>Saunders sprang for the lantern, lit it, and catching
it up, Alex was out the door, and off across the tracks
through the still pouring rain for the lights of the
section foreman&#8217;s house. Darting through the gate,
he ran about to the kitchen door, and without ceremony
flung it open. The foreman was at the table,
at his supper. He started to his feet.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Joe, there is a wild ore train coming down from
the Canyon,&#8221; explained Alex breathlessly, &#8220;and the
wire has failed east so we can&#8217;t clear the line.
Couldn&#8217;t we get the jigger out and board the runaways
by letting them catch us?&#8221;
</p>
<p>An instant the section-boss stared, then with the
promptitude of the old railroader seized his cap, exclaiming
&#8220;Go ahead!&#8221; and together they dashed out
to the gate, and across the tracks in the direction of
the tool-house.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where did they start from? How many cars?&#8221;
asked the foreman as they ran.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Indian Canyon. Ten, and all loaded.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The section-man whistled. &#8220;They&#8217;ll be going
twenty-five or thirty miles an hour. We will be taking
a big chance. But if we can catch them just over
the grade beyond the sand-pits I guess we can do it.
That will have slackened them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here we are.&#8221;
</p>
<p>As they halted before the section-house door the
boss uttered a cry. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t the key!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Alex swung the lantern about, and discovered a
pile of ties. &#8220;Smash it in,&#8221; he suggested, dropping
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
the lantern. One on either side they caught up a tie,
swayed back, and hurled it forward. There was a
crash, and the door swung open.
</p>
<p>Catching up the lantern, they dashed in, threw from
the hand-car its collection of tools, placed the light
upon it, ran it out, and swung it onto the rails.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you hear them?&#8221; asked Alex as he threw off
his coat. The foreman dropped to his knees and
placed his ear to the rails, listened a moment, and
sprang to his feet. &#8220;Yes, they&#8217;re coming! Come
on!
</p>
<p>&#8220;Run her a ways first.&#8221; They pushed the car
ahead, quickly had it on the run, and springing aboard,
seized the handles, and one on either side, began pumping
up and down with all their strength.
</p>
<p>As they neared the station the door opened and
Saunders ran to the edge of the platform. &#8220;The
wire came O K and I just heard Z pass Thirty-three,&#8221;
he shouted, &#8220;but couldn&#8217;t make them hear me. He
reported the superintendent&#8217;s&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>They whirled by, and the rest was lost.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you catch it?&#8221; shouted Alex above the roar
of the car.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think he meant,&#8221; shouted the foreman as he
swung up and down, &#8220;superintendent&#8217;s car ... attached
to the Accommodation ... heard he was
coming ... makes it bad.... We need every minute
QQQ and Old Jerry ... the engineer ... &#8217;ll be
breaking his neck ... to bring her ... through on
time!
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you hear ... runaways yet?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;
</p>

<br />
</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span></div>
<p>On they rushed through the darkness, bobbing up
and down like jumping-jacks, the little car rumbling
and screeching, and bounding forward like a live
thing.
</p>
<p>The terrific and unaccustomed strain began to tell
on Alex. Perspiration broke out on his forehead, his
muscles began to burn, and his breath to shorten.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How much farther ... to the grade?&#8221; he
panted.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here it is now. Six hundred yards to the
top.&#8221;
</p>
<p>As they felt the resistance of the incline Alex began
to weaken and gasp for breath. Grimly, however, he
clenched his teeth, and fought on; and at last the
section-man suddenly ceased working, and announced
&#8220;Here we are. Let up.&#8221; With a gasp of relief
Alex dropped to a sitting position on the side of the
car.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There it comes,&#8221; said the foreman a moment after,
and listening Alex heard a sound as of distant thunder.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How long before they&#8217;ll be here?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Five minutes, perhaps. And now,&#8221; said the section-boss,
&#8220;just how are we going to work this
thing?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, when we boarded the engine at Bixton,&#8221;
explained Alex, getting his breath, &#8220;we simply waited
at the head of a grade until it was within about two
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
hundred yards of us, then lit out just as hard as we
could go, and as she bumped us, we jumped.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right. We&#8217;ll do the same.&#8221;
</p>
<p>As the foreman spoke, the rain, which had decreased
to a drizzle, entirely ceased, and a moment after the
moon appeared. He and Alex at once turned toward
the station.
</p>
<p>Just beyond was a long, black, snake-like object,
shooting along the rails toward them.
</p>
<p>The runaway!
</p>
<p>On it swept over the glistening irons, the rumble
quickly increasing to a roar. With an echoing crash
it flashed by the station, and on.
</p>
<p>Nearer it came, the cars leaping and writhing;
roaring, pounding, screeching.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ready!&#8221; warned the foreman, springing to the
ground behind the hand-car. Alex joined him, and
gazing over their shoulder, watching, they braced
themselves for the shove.
</p>
<p>The runaways reached the incline, and swept on upward.
Anxiously the two watched as they waited.
Would the incline check them?
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see that they&#8217;re slowing,&#8221; Alex said somewhat
nervously.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t tell until they are half way up the grade,&#8221;
declared the section-man. &#8220;But, get ready. We
can&#8217;t wait to see.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Go!&#8221; he cried. Running the car forward, they
leaped aboard, and again were pumping with all their
might.
</p>

THE ENGINEER STEPPED DOWN FROM HIS CAB TO GRASP ALEX&#8217;S<br />
HAND.
<br />
</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span></div>
<p>For a few moments the roar behind them seemed
to decrease. Then suddenly it broke on them afresh,
and the head of the train swept over the rise.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now pull yourself together for an extra spurt
when I give the word,&#8221; shouted the foreman, who
manned the forward handles, and faced the rear,
&#8220;then turn about and get ready to jump.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Roaring, screaming, clanking, the runaways thundered
down upon them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hit it up!&#8221; cried the section-man. With every
muscle tense they whirled the handles up and down
like human engines.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let go! Turn about!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Alex sprang back from the flying handles, and faced
about. The foreman edged by them, and joined him.
</p>
<p>Nearer, towering over them, rushed the leading ore
car.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Be sure and jump high and grab hard,&#8221; shouted
the foreman.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ready! <i>Jump</i>!&#8221;
</p>
<p>With a bound they went into the air, and the great
car flung itself at them. Both reached the top of the
end-board with their outstretched hands, and gripped
tenaciously. As they swung against it, it seemed the
car would shake them off. But clinging desperately,
they got their feet on the brake-beam, and in another
moment had tumbled headlong within.
</p>
<p>Alex sank down on the rough ore in a heap, gasping.
The seasoned section-man, however, was on his
feet and at the nearby hand-brake in a twinkle.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
Tightening it, he scrambled back over the bounding
car to the next.
</p>
<p>Ten minutes later, screeching and groaning as
though in protest, the runaways came to a final stop.
</p>
<p>Another ten minutes, and the engineer of the Accommodation
suddenly threw on his air as he rounded
a curve to discover a lantern swinging across the rails
ahead of him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello there, Jerry! Say, you&#8217;re not good enough
for a passenger run,&#8221; said the section foreman humorously
as he approached the astonished engineer.
&#8220;We&#8217;re going to put you back pushing ore cars.
There&#8217;s a string here just ahead of you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>When he had explained the engineer stepped down
from his cab to grasp Alex&#8217;s hand. &#8220;Oh, it was more
the foreman than I,&#8221; Alex declared. &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t
have worked it alone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A moment later the superintendent appeared.
&#8220;Why, let me see,&#8221; he exclaimed on seeing Alex.
&#8220;Are you not the lad I helped fix up an emergency
battery at Watson Siding last spring? And who has
been responsible for two or three other similar clever
affairs?
</p>
<p>&#8220;My boy, young as you are, my name&#8217;s not Cameron
if I don&#8217;t see that you have a try-out at the division
office before the month is out,&#8221; he announced
decisively. &#8220;We need men there with a head like
yours.&#8221;
</p>

<h2>XI</h2>
<h3>THE HAUNTED STATION</h3>
</div>

<p>True to the division superintendent&#8217;s promise,
a month following the incident of the runaway
ore train, Alex was transferred to the despatching
office at Exeter. It was the superintendent himself
who on the evening of his arrival presented him for
duty to the chief night despatcher; and a few minutes
later, having been initiated into the mysteries of directing
and recording the movements of trains, Alex
was shown to his wire.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a short line&mdash;only as far as the Midway
freight junction,&#8221; the chief explained; &#8220;but if you
make good here, you will soon be given something
bigger.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And, by the way, take your time in sending to
the operator at the Junction,&#8221; he added. &#8220;He&#8217;s a
rather poor receiver, but was the only man we could
get to go there, on account of that so-called &#8216;haunting&#8217;
business.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, has the &#8216;ghost&#8217; appeared there again?&#8221; inquired
Alex with interest. For the &#8220;haunting&#8221; of
the Midway Junction station had been a subject of
much discussion on the main-line wire a few weeks
back.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, two nights ago. And like the four men there
before him, the night man left next morning. It is
a strange affair. But I think the man there now will
stick.&#8221;
</p>
<p>At midnight Alex called Midway Junction, and
sent the order starting north the last freight for the
night. Fifteen minutes later the operator at MJ suddenly
called, and clicked, &#8220;That &#8216;Thing&#8217; is here
again. It&#8217;s walking up and down the platform just
outside.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There it is now!&#8221; he sent excitedly. &#8220;And twice
I&#8217;ve jumped out, and the moment I opened the door
it was gone!
</p>
<p>&#8220;There it is again!
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now it&#8217;s on the roof!&#8221; he announced a few
moments after. &#8220;Rolling something down&mdash;just
like the other chaps said! Gee, I&#8217;m no coward, but
this thing is getting my nerve.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Though himself now considerably excited, Alex
sought to reassure the MJ man. &#8220;But you know
there must be some simple explanation to it,&#8221; he sent.
&#8220;No one really believes in ghosts these days. Just
don&#8217;t allow yourself to be frightened.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I know,&#8221; ticked the sounder. &#8220;That&#8217;s what
I told myself before I came. It seems vastly different,
though, right here on the spot, and all by yourself,
and it dark as pitch outside. If there was only someone
else&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>The wire abruptly closed, a moment remained so,
then suddenly opened, and in signals so excitedly
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
made that Alex could only guess at some of them,
he read: &#8220;Did you hear that? Did you get that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hear what? The wire was closed to me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Clooossclosd! Goed 6eavns! Whiiieeeeee
Whyyy&mdash;&#8221; By an effort the frightened operator at
the other end of the wire pulled himself together, and
sent more plainly:
</p>
<p>&#8220;When I stopped that time someone broke in here
and said: &#8216;Ha ha! Hi hi! Look behind! Look
beh&mdash;&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Again the wire closed, again opened.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Theeeereit waaawas again!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Alex called the chief. &#8220;Mr. Allen, that &#8216;ghost,&#8217; or
whatever it is&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Once more the instruments broke out in an almost
inarticulate whirr, and with difficulty together they
picked out the words: &#8220;... sounds in the next room ... yelling
and groaning just other side partition ... whispering
at me through a knot-hole ... an eye looking at me ... stand it any longer ... right
now! G. B. (Good-by)!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Grasping the key, the chief sent quickly, &#8220;Look
here! Wait a moment! You there?&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was no response. Again he called, and gave
it up. &#8220;No use. He&#8217;s off like the rest of them.
Well, I&#8217;m not sure I blame him. There must be
something wrong. But it beats me!&#8221;
</p>
<p>As he was about to move away the chief turned
back and handed Alex a letter. &#8220;I overlooked giving
it to you when you came in,&#8221; he explained.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span></p>
<p>&#8220;From Jack Orr!&#8221; said Alex with pleasure. A
moment later he uttered a second exclamation, again
read a paragraph, and with a delighted &#8220;The very
thing!&#8221; hastened after the chief.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Allen, this letter is from a friend of mine,
a first class commercial operator, who wants to get
into railroad telegraphing, and who would be just the
man to send to MJ.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He is a regular amateur detective, and has all
kinds of pluck,&#8221; Alex went on, and in a few words
recounted Jack&#8217;s clearing up of the cash-box mystery
at Hammerton, the part he played in the breaking up
of the band of Black-Handers, and his resourcefulness
when the wires were cut at Oakton.
</p>
<p>The chief smiled and reached for a message blank.
&#8220;Thank you, Ward,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That&#8217;s the man we
want exactly. How soon can he come?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He says he could take a place with us right away,
sir.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good. We&#8217;ll have him there if possible to-morrow
evening,&#8221; decided the chief, writing.
</p>
<p>Needless to say Jack was delighted when early
the following morning at Hammerton he received
the telegraphed appointment to the station at
Midway. At once resigning at the Hammerton
commercial office, he hurried home, by noon was
on the train, and arrived at Midway Junction at 7
o&#8217;clock.
</p>
<p>Entering the telegraph room, he called Exeter.
&#8220;Well, here I am, Al,&#8221; he ticked, when Alex himself
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
responded. &#8220;And I&#8217;m ever so much obliged to you,
old boy, for getting me the position.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t mention it. And anyway,&#8221; responded Alex,
&#8220;you had better save your thanks until you learn just
what you are up against there. I didn&#8217;t have time to
write&mdash;but the former man left last night, simply on
the run.&#8221; And continuing, Alex explained.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So you see, you were called in as a sort of expert.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hi,&#8221; laughed Jack. &#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll do the best I
can. But probably the &#8216;ghost&#8217; won&#8217;t show up again
now for a month or so?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;On the contrary, it is more likely to return soon,&#8221;
clicked Alex. &#8220;That has been the way every time
so far&mdash;three or four appearances in succession. So
you had better prepare for business at once.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Alex&#8217;s prediction was realized two nights later. A
few minutes after the last freight had gone north, and
Jack had been left entirely alone in the big station, he
heard light footfalls outside on the platform. Going
to the window, he peered out into the darkness, and
seeing nothing, turned to the door. As he opened
it the footsteps ceased.
</p>
<p>Surprised, Jack returned and secured a lantern, and
passed out and down the long platform. From end
to end it was deserted and silent.
</p>
<p>He returned to the office. Scarcely had he closed
the door when again came the sound of footsteps.
</p>
<p>Jack paused and listened. They were light and
quick, like those of a woman&mdash;up and down, up and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
down, now pausing a moment, now briskly resuming,
as though the walker was anxiously waiting for someone.
</p>
<p>On tiptoe Jack went back to the door, suddenly
flung it open and flashed the lantern. As quickly the
steps had ceased. Not a moving object was to be
seen.
</p>
<p>Immensely puzzled, Jack withdrew, and stepped to
the instrument table. As he reached toward the telegraph
key from almost directly overhead broke out a
thundering rumble, as of a heavy wooden ball bounding
down the roof.
</p>
<p>Catching up the lantern, he once more rushed forth.
Immediately, as before, all was silence. Nervous at
last, in spite of himself, Jack hesitated, then resolutely
set forth on a complete round of the station and
freight shed, throwing the lantern light upon the roof,
through the dusty windows, and into every nook and
corner. Nowhere was there a sign of life.
</p>
<p>He returned. The moment he closed the office door
the rumble broke out afresh.
</p>
<p>Jack sprang to the instruments, called Exeter, and
sent rapidly, &#8220;Al, that &#8216;ghost&#8217; is here, and in spite
of me, is beginning to get on my&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>The line opened, then sharply clicked: &#8220;Look behind!
Look behind!&#8221;
</p>
<p>With a cry Jack was on his feet, and had started
for the door. Half way he pulled up, with a determined
effort controlled his panic, and returned to the
key.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
&#8220;I suppose you didn&#8217;t hear that, Al?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a letter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, good gracious, what&mdash;<i>Oh!</i>&#8221;
</p>
<p>A cold chill shot up Jack&#8217;s back. The cause was a
low, long-drawn moan, apparently from just the other
side of the wooden partition, in the freight room.
Again it came, then suddenly ceased to give place to
a low, tense whispering immediately behind him.
Jack sprang about, and leaped to his feet. Within
touch of him was a large knot-hole.
</p>
<p>And was there not an eye at it? Peering at him?
</p>
<p>He sprang toward it.
</p>
<p>No! Nothing! The whispering, too, had ceased.
</p>
<p>Thoroughly shaken, Jack again turned for his hat&mdash;and
again faltered between the chair and the door.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You there, Jack?&#8221; clicked Alex. &#8220;Hang on, old
boy. Keep your nerve.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Clenching his teeth and gripping his hands Jack
regained control of himself, and returned to the instruments.
&#8220;Thanks, Al,&#8221; he sent. &#8220;I was about
all in, sure enough. But I am OK again now, and
going to stick it out unless &#8216;they,&#8217; or &#8216;it,&#8217; or whatever
it is, lugs me off bodily.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the talk,&#8221; said Alex encouragingly. &#8220;I
knew you&#8217;d make good. Just keep on telling yourself
there must be some natural explanation somehow,
and you&#8217;ll win out OK.&#8221;
</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s my cue&mdash;&#8216;a natural explanation
somehow,&#8217;&#8221; Jack repeated to himself the following
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
afternoon as he left the big railroad boarding-house,
a half mile from the station, and set out for a walk,
to think things over.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And I believe the starting point is that talk on the
wire. That certainly is the work of an operator.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, why is it heard only at this office?
</p>
<p>&#8220;Say! Could it be on the loop? A cut-off arrangement
on the station loop?
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go down and look into that right now,&#8221; declared
Jack, and turning about, headed for the station.
</p>
<p>The platforms and the big freight shed were alive
with the bustle of the freight handlers, loading and
unloading cars, trundling boxes and bales from one
part of the platform to another and in and out of the
big shed; and unnoticed, Jack discovered where the
wires from the pole passed in under the roof. Entering
the shed, he proceeded carefully to follow their
course along the beams toward the telegraph room.
He had almost reached the partition, and was beginning
to think his conclusion perhaps too hastily drawn,
when a few feet from the wall, where the light from
an opposite window struck the roof, he caught two
unmistakable gleams of copper. With a suppressed
cry he made his way directly beneath, and at once saw
that the insulation of both wires of the loop had been
cut through.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Right! I was right!&#8221; exclaimed Jack jubilantly
beneath his breath. &#8220;And I can see in a minute how
it&#8217;s done. Whoever it is, simply gets up there somehow,
and ticks one wire against the other&mdash;and of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
course the instruments inside click as they are alternately
cut off and cut on, and the rest of the line is
not affected!
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good! I&#8217;m on the trail.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But what can be the object of it all?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jack turned to look about him, and as in answer the
lettering of a nearby box caught his eye:
</p>
<p>&#8220;VALUABLE! HANDLE WITH CARE!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Freight stealing! Could that be it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>On reporting for duty that evening Jack called Alex
on the wire and asked if any freight had recently been
reported missing from the Midway depot.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, but I understand some valuable stuff has been
mysteriously disappearing at Claxton and Eastfield,&#8221;
was the reply.
</p>
<p>Jack was considerably disappointed; but before
giving up this line of investigation he determined to
study the freight records of the station, to discover
whether any freight for the two places mentioned by
Alex had passed through Midway. A few minutes&#8217;
search produced the record of a valuable shipment
of silk to Claxton. A moment later he found another.
</p>
<p>When presently he found still others, and several to
Eastfield, he hurried back to the wire and calling Alex
asked the nature of the goods lost track of at those
stations, and breathlessly awaited the reply.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll ask,&#8221; said Alex&mdash;&#8220;Silverware and silk.
Mostly silk.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jack uttered a shout. &#8220;Hurrah, Alex,&#8221; he whirred,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
&#8220;I&#8217;m on the track of our friend the &#8216;ghost.&#8217; But
keep mum.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And now the question is,&#8221; he told himself, leaning
back in his chair, &#8220;how do they work it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The answer to the query came very unexpectedly as
Jack left the station office at daybreak. Strolling
down the front platform, where several men already
were at work unloading a car, he inadvertently got in
the way of a loaded truck. On the sudden cry of the
truckman he sprang aside, tripped, and fell headlong
against a large, square packing-case. As he did so,
he distinctly heard from within a sharp &#8220;Oh!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Only with difficulty did Jack avoid crying out, and
scrambling to his feet, hastened away, that his discovery
might not be suspected by the man in the
box.
</p>
<p>The whole mystery was now clear. The &#8220;ghost&#8221;
was a freight thief, who had himself shipped, in a
box, to some point which would necessitate his being
transferred and held over night at the freight junction.
He played &#8220;ghost&#8221; either to frighten the operator
away, or to lead to the belief that any noises overheard
were caused by &#8220;spirits,&#8221; then overhauled the
valuable freight in the shed, took what he wanted with
him into his own box (which supposedly he could open
and close from the inside), and was shipped away with
it the following morning. The rifled packages, carefully
re-sealed, also went on to their several destinations,
and the blame of the theft was laid elsewhere.
</p>
<p>Jack was not long in deciding upon his next move.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
Coming down from the boarding-house before the
sheds had been closed that afternoon, he noted where
the box containing the unsuspected human freight had
been placed, and selecting a window at the far end of
the shed, seized a favorable moment to quietly loosen
its catch.
</p>
<p>It was near midnight, and Jack was once more the
sole guardian of the station when he took the next
step. And despite a certain nervousness, now that the
exciting moment was at hand, he found considerable
amusement in carrying it out.
</p>
<p>It was nothing less than making up a dummy imitation
of himself asleep on a cot in a corner of
the telegraph room&mdash;as a precaution against the
&#8220;ghost&#8221; peering within to learn the effect of his
&#8220;haunting.&#8221;
</p>
<p>In making the dummy Jack used a brown fur cap
for the head, a glimpse of which under an old hat
looked remarkably like his own brown head. A collection
of old overalls and record books carefully arranged
formed the body, and his own shoes the feet.
</p>
<p>When over the whole he threw his overcoat, the
deception was complete. Chuckling at the subterfuge,
Jack lost no time in slipping forth for the next step
in his program.
</p>
<p>Tiptoeing down the platform to the window whose
latch he had loosened, he softly raised it, listened, and
climbing through, dropped noiselessly to the floor.
Feeling his way in the darkness amid the bales and
boxes, he reached a nook behind a piano-case he had
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
previously noted, and settling down, prepared to await
the appearance of the &#8220;spectre.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The wait was not long. Scarcely had he made himself
comfortable when from the direction of the big
packing-case came the muffled sound of a screw-driver.
Soon there followed a noise as of a board being softly
shoved aside, then a step on the floor. Simultaneously
there was the crackle of a match, and peering forth
Jack momentarily made out a thin, clean-shaven face
bending over a dark-lantern. But quickly he drew
back with a start of fright as the man turned and
came directly toward him.
</p>
<p>A few feet away, however, the intruder halted, and
again peering cautiously forth Jack discovered the lantern,
closely muffled, on the floor, and beside it the dim
figure of the man working with his hands at a plank.
As Jack watched, wondering, the plank came up.
Laying it aside carefully, the stranger stepped down
into the opening, recovered the lantern, and disappeared.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now what under the sun is he up to?&#8221; exclaimed
Jack to himself.
</p>
<p>From the platform outside came the sound of footsteps.
Jack started, listened a moment, and uttered a
low cry of triumph. At last he understood.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what a dolt I am,&#8221; he laughed. &#8220;Why
didn&#8217;t I think of that?
</p>
<p>&#8220;The fellow is simply out beneath the platform,
making sounds against the under side of the planking&mdash;probably
with a stick!&#8221;
</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>

<p class='caption' style='text-align:center;'>
JACK MADE OUT A THIN, CLEAN-SHAVEN FACE BENDING OVER<br />
A DARK-LANTERN.
<br />
</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span></div>
<p>Jack was still chuckling delightedly over this simple
explanation of the mysterious &#8220;walking&#8221; when the
noise ceased, and the light of the lantern returned.
</p>
<p>On reappearing, the unknown dragged after him a
long pole. As Jack watched, puzzling over its use,
the &#8220;spectre&#8221; hoisted the pole to his shoulder, cautiously
picked his way amid the freight to the telegraph-room
partition, and mounted a large box.
</p>
<p>And then, while Jack fairly shook with internal
laughter, he laboriously raised the pole, and began
bumping and scraping it up and down the under side
of the roof.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Natural explanations!&#8221; bubbled Jack through his
handkerchief. &#8220;And imagine anyone being frightened
at it&mdash;beating it for home!&#8221;
</p>
<p>When the man on the box had concluded his second
&#8220;demonstration,&#8221; and descended, Jack had cause to
thank himself for his precaution in leaving the dummy.
Evidently puzzled at the silence in the operating-room,
the man placed his eye to the knot-hole in the partition,
and peered through. Muttering something in
surprise, he listened closely, and looked again, while
Jack looked on, shaking, and holding his mouth. Apparently
at last satisfied that the &#8220;operator&#8221; within
was asleep at his post, the intruder turned about and
threw a shaft of light up toward the wires of the loop.
Expectantly Jack waited. Had he also guessed right
here?
</p>
<p>But to his disappointment, after a brief debate with
himself, the &#8220;ghost&#8221; muttered, &#8220;If he&#8217;s asleep,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
what&#8217;s the use?&#8221; And catching up the pole, he returned
it to the hole in the floor, and replaced the
plank.
</p>
<p>Then, in final confirmation of Jack&#8217;s deductions,
the intruder turned his attention to the packages of
merchandise about him, speedily selected a box, and
proceeded to open it.
</p>
<p>For several hours the unsuspecting freight robber
worked, frequently returning to the crack in the partition
to assure himself that the negligent &#8220;operator&#8221;
there was still in the land of dreams, each time to
Jack&#8217;s great amusement. And finally, having secured
all the booty he could handle, and having carefully
closed the cases from which it had been taken, he
moved the plunder into his own box, crept in after;
again came the squeak of the screw-driver&mdash;and the
robbery was complete.
</p>
<p>At once Jack crept from his place of concealment,
and back to the window; dropped out, and was off
on the run for the boarding-house. And twenty
minutes after he returned with the freight-house
foreman and several freight hands, armed, and with
lanterns.
</p>
<p>Entering by the door, he led them directly to the
robber&#8217;s box.
</p>
<p>Sharply the foreman kicked at it, and called,
&#8220;Hello, in there! Your little game is up, my friend!
Come out!&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was no response, and he drew his revolver.
&#8220;Open up quick, or I&#8217;ll shoot!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, all right! All right!&#8221; cried a muffled voice
hurriedly.
</p>
<p>The next moment the Midway Junction &#8220;ghost&#8221;
stepped grimly from his box, and stood before them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But look here, youngster,&#8221; ticked the chief despatcher,
who some minutes later followed Alex Ward
on the wire in congratulating Jack on the solution of
the mystery, &#8220;don&#8217;t you talk too much about this
business, or first thing you know they&#8217;ll be taking
you from the telegraph force, and adding you to the
detective department. We want you ourselves.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No fear,&#8221; laughed Jack. &#8220;I might try a matter
like this once in a while, but I want to work up as
an operator, not a detective.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll work up OK,&#8221; declared the chief.
</p>

<h2>XII</h2>
<h3>IN A BAD FIX, AND OUT</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Good evening, young man!&#8221;
</p>
<p>With a start Jack turned toward the quietly
opened door of the telegraph-room to discover a short,
dark, heavily-bearded man, over whose eyes was pulled
a soft gray hat.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose you don&#8217;t have many visitors at the station
at this time of night?&#8221; said the stranger, entering.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; but you are quite welcome. Have a chair,&#8221;
responded Jack courteously.
</p>
<p>To the young operator&#8217;s surprise, the stranger drew
the chair immediately before him, and seating himself,
leaned forward secretively. &#8220;My name is
Watts,&#8221; he began, in a low voice, &#8220;and I&#8217;ve come on
business. For you are the lad who worked out that
&#8216;ghost&#8217; mystery here, and caused the capture of the
freight robber, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; confirmed Jack, in further wonder.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought so. I thought as much. I know a
clever lad when I see one. And that was one of the
cleverest bits of detective work I ever heard of,&#8221; declared
Mr. Watts, with a winning smile. &#8220;If the
railroad detectives had done their work as well, the
whole freight-stealing gang would have been landed.
As it was none of the rest were caught, were they?&#8221;
</p>

THE STRANGER DREW THE CHAIR IMMEDIATELY BEFORE HIM,<br />
AND SEATING HIMSELF, LEANED FORWARD SECRETIVELY.
<br />
</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span></div>
<p>Instead of being pleased, the man&#8217;s flattery and ingratiating
manner had ruffled Jack, and briefly he
answered, &#8220;No, sir.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No. I knew that already. I was one of them
myself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>At this startling statement Jack stared. &#8220;I beg
your pardon, sir?&#8221; he exclaimed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was a member of that gang myself,&#8221; repeated
Jack&#8217;s strange caller, again smiling broadly. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
you think I look the part?&#8221; So saying, he pushed his
hat back from his face.
</p>
<p>Jack had no doubt of it. The small dark eyes were
repellent with low cunning and greed. Instinctively
he half turned to cast a glance toward the door. At
once the smile disappeared, and the self-confessed
law-breaker threw open his coat and significantly
tapped the butt of a revolver. &#8220;No. You just sit
still and listen,&#8221; he ordered sharply; but immediately
again smiling, added, &#8220;though there needn&#8217;t be anything
of this kind between two who are going to be
good friends.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen. What I called for was this: We want
another man in the gang in place of Joe Corry&mdash;that
is the man you caught.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And we decided to invite you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jack fairly caught his breath. &#8220;Why, you must be
joking, or&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Or crazy, eh? Not quite. I was never more
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
serious in my life. Listen!&#8221; The speaker leaned
forward earnestly. &#8220;After your spoiling our little
&#8216;ghost&#8217; game here the railroad people would never
look for us starting in again at the same place. Never
in the world&mdash;would they? And likewise, after your
causing the capture of Corry, they would never in the
world suspect you of working with us. Do you see
the point?
</p>
<p>&#8220;And all you would have to do would be to keep
your ears closed, and not hear any noises out in the
freight-room at night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And for doing that,&#8221; concluded the law-breaker,
&#8220;we will give you a regular salary of $25 a month.
We&#8217;ll send it by mail, or bank it for you at any bank
you name, and no one will know where it comes from.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you say?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jack drew back indignantly. &#8220;Most certainly not,&#8221;
he began. Then suddenly he hesitated.
</p>
<p>As the freight-robber had said, the authorities had
been unable to obtain a single clue to the whereabouts
or identity of the remainder of the freight-stealing
gang. Should he accept the man&#8217;s offer, came the
thought, undoubtedly, sooner or later, he would be able
to bring about the capture of every one of them.
</p>
<p>Immediately following, however, there recurred to
Jack one of his mother&#8217;s warnings&mdash;&#8220;that even the
appearance of evil is dangerous, always, as well as
wrong.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But this would be quite different, Jack argued to
himself&mdash;to cause the capture of criminals. And
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
what possible danger could there be in it? No one
would believe for an instant that I would go into such
a thing seriously, he told himself.
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, Mr. Watts,&#8221; he said aloud. &#8220;I&#8217;ll do
it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good! It&#8217;s a go!&#8221; The freight-stealer spoke
with satisfaction, and rising, grasped Jack&#8217;s hand. &#8220;I
told you I knew a clever boy when I saw one&mdash;and
that means a wise one.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s all there is to it, excepting the money
matter. Where will we send that? Here?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jack responded with an effort. &#8220;Yes, you may as
well send it to me here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right. Look for it at the end of the month,&#8221;
said Watts, proceeding to the door.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Remember, you are dumb. That&#8217;s all. Good
night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jack&#8217;s sense of honor was not long in convincing
him that he had made a mistake in entering into such
a bargain, even with a law-breaker. A dozen times
during the days that followed he would have given
anything to have been able to wipe out the agreement.
</p>
<p>Unhappily this dissatisfaction with himself was to
prove but a minor result of the misstep.
</p>
<p>Shortly after he had relieved the day operator at
the station a week later he was surprised by the appearance
of one of the road detectives, and with him a
stranger.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good evening, Orr,&#8221; said the detective in a peculiar
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
tone. &#8220;Let me make you acquainted with Sheriff
Bates.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jack started, and glanced from one to the other.
&#8220;Is there anything wrong?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very slightly. Your little game is up, that&#8217;s all.
Your older partner has given the thing away, and we
have just found the watch in your room at the boarding-house,&#8221;
announced the detective.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Given the thing away? The watch? Why, what
do you mean?&#8221; exclaimed Jack in alarm.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, come! Watts has squealed, and we found the
watch hidden, just as he said, in the mattress of your
bed up at the house.&#8221;
</p>
<p>In a flash Jack saw it all. Watts&#8217; offer had been a
trap! A mere trap to get him into trouble, probably
in revenge!
</p>
<p>He sprang to his feet. &#8220;It&#8217;s not true! It&#8217;s false!
Whatever it is, it&#8217;s false! I did see Watts, and he
asked me to go in with them, but I only agreed so as
to learn who they were, so we could capture them!&#8221;
</p>
<p>To his utter dismay the two officers only laughed
drily.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no! That&#8217;s quite too thin,&#8221; declared the
detective. &#8220;Read this.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Blankly Jack took the letter, and read:
</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>&#8220;Chief Detective,
</p>
<p>&#8220;Middle Western R. R.
</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Dear Sir:</span> The young night operator at Midway
Junction has joined the freight-stealing gang that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
Corry belonged to, and if you will look under the mattress
in his room at the railroad boarding-house you
will find a watch and chain of the lot we stole at Claxton
two weeks ago. I gave it to him last Friday
night. I came to Midway by the Eastfield freight,
and when I saw another operator in the station office,
I started up towards the boarding-house, and met Orr
coming down. I mention this to show my story is
all straight.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I heard he was going to give us away as soon
as he had got enough loot himself, and claim he only
went in with us to get us. That is why I am showing
him up.
</p>
<div class='ra'>
<p style='text-align: right; '>&#8220;Yours truly,</p>
<p style='text-align: right; '>&#8220;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>W. Watts.</span>&#8221;</p>
</div>

</div>
<p>And the day operator <i>had</i> worked for him that
Friday evening, while he was at the landlady&#8217;s daughter&#8217;s
birthday party! And he <i>had</i> come down to the
station at about the time the Eastfield night freight
came in!
</p>
<p>Jack sank back in the chair, completely crushed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Changed your mind, eh?&#8221; remarked the sheriff
sarcastically.
</p>
<p>Jack shook his head, but said nothing. What
could he say!
</p>
<p>&#8220;If it&#8217;s &#8216;false,&#8217; as you claim, how do you explain
our finding the watch in your room?&#8221; demanded the
detective.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. Someone must have put it there.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Very likely. It wouldn&#8217;t have crept up stairs and
got under the bed itself. And I suppose you will deny
also that you saw Watts on the night of the party,
despite the fact that he could not otherwise have
known the unusual hour you came down to the station
that night. Eh?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I never saw him after the night he called here,&#8221;
affirmed Jack earnestly, but hopelessly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you will have to prove it,&#8221; declared the
sheriff. And to Jack&#8217;s unspeakable horror he was
informed he must be taken into custody.
</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Needless to say, the news of Jack&#8217;s arrest, and of his
early trial at Eastfield, the county seat, came as a
tremendous shock to Alex, at Exeter. Of course he
thoroughly disbelieved in Jack&#8217;s guilt, despite the net
of circumstantial evidence which, according to the
newspapers, had been woven about his friend; and
morning and afternoon he read and re-read the papers,
in the hope of something more favorable to Jack developing.
</p>
<p>It was through this close reading that Alex finally
came upon the discovery that was to draw him into the
case himself, and to have so important a bearing on
the outcome of the trial.
</p>
<p>Early in the evening preceding the day set for the
hearing, Alex, before starting work on his wire, was
studying the paper as usual. For the second time he
was reading the letter from the man Watts that had
had such serious results for Jack.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span></p>
<p>Suddenly as he read Alex started, again read a portion
of the letter, a moment thought deeply, and with
a cry sprang to his feet and hastened to the chief
despatcher&#8217;s desk.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Allen,&#8221; he said excitedly, &#8220;in this letter Watts
says he reached Midway Junction that Friday night
by the Eastfield freight, and that he met and gave
Jack Orr the watch after that.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now I remember distinctly that it was Jack reported
the arrival of the Eastfield freight that night.
She was twenty minutes late, and I recall asking if
she was in sight yet, and his reply that she had just
whistled.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That means Jack was back at the station before
the time at which Watts claims he met him!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ward, why in the world didn&#8217;t you think of
this before?&#8221; the chief exclaimed. &#8220;It is the
most important piece of evidence your friend could
have.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Call Eastfield right away on the long-distance, and
get Orr&#8217;s lawyer, and tell him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Alex hastily did so, and a few minutes after he
heard the lawyer&#8217;s voice from the distant town, and
quickly told his story.
</p>
<p>To his surprise the lawyer for a moment remained
silent, then said slowly, &#8220;Of course I would like to
believe that. In fact it would make an invaluable piece
of evidence&mdash;practically conclusive.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But really now, how could you be sure it was Orr
you heard? What possible difference can there be
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
between the ticks made over a telegraph wire by one
distant operator, and those made by another?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, all the difference in the world, sometimes,
sir,&#8221; declared Jack. &#8220;Any operator would tell you
that. I would recognize Jack Orr&#8217;s sending anywhere
I heard it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But the lawyer at the other end was still incredulous.
&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said at last, &#8220;if the jury was made up of
telegraph operators, perhaps your claim might go.
As it is, however&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, I have it!&#8221; cried Alex. &#8220;Let me give a
demonstration right there in court of my ability to
identify the sending of as many different operators
as we can get together, including Jack Orr. Could
you arrange that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The lawyer was interested at last. &#8220;But could you
really do it? Are you really that sure?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am absolutely positive,&#8221; declared Alex.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you come right ahead,&#8221; was the decisive
response. &#8220;Come down here by the first train in the
morning, and bring two or three other operators, and
the necessary instruments.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And if you can prove what you claim, I&#8217;ll guarantee
that your friend is clear.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurrah! Then he is clear!&#8221; cried Alex joyously.
</p>
<p>Accompanied by three other operators from the
Exeter office, and with a set of telegraph instruments
and a convenient dry-battery, Alex reached the court-room
at Eastfield at 10 o&#8217;clock the following morning.
</p>
<p>The trial, which had attracted a crowd that packed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
the building to its capacity, already had neared its
conclusion. Jack&#8217;s demeanor, and that of his father,
who was beside him, quickly informed Alex that matters
were looking serious for his chum. Confidently
he waited, however, and at last the court clerk arose
and called his name.
</p>
<p>The preliminary questions were passed, and Jack&#8217;s
attorney at once proceeded. &#8220;Now Alex,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;this letter here, which has been put in evidence, declares
that the writer, Watts, went to Midway Junction
by the Eastfield freight on the Friday night in
question, and that he then met the defendant coming
down to the station from his boarding-house, and gave
him the watch.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you anything to say to this?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir. Jack Orr was at the telegraph instruments
in the Midway Junction station several minutes
before the Eastfield freight reached there that night.
It was he who reported her coming over the wire to
me at Exeter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The lawyer for the prosecution looked up with surprise,
then smiled in amusement, while Jack and his
father started, and exchanged glances of new hope.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are positive it was the defendant you heard
over the wire?&#8221; asked Mr. Brown.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Positive, sir.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If necessary could you give a demonstration here
in court of your ability to identify the defendant&#8217;s
transmitting on a telegraph instrument?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir, I could.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span></p>
<p>When the lawyer for the other side arose to cross-examine
Alex he smiled somewhat derisively.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are a friend of the defendant, are you not?&#8221;
he asked significantly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir; and so know his sending over the wire
unusually well,&#8221; responded Alex, cleverly turning the
point of the question.
</p>
<p>The lawyer shrugged his shoulders, and put the
next question with sarcasm. &#8220;And, now, do you mean
to stand there and tell this court that the clicks&mdash;the
purely mechanical clicks&mdash;made over a telegraph
wire by an operator miles away will sound different
to the clicks made by any other operator?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I do,&#8221; said Alex quietly. &#8220;And I am ready to
demonstrate it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you are, are you? And how, pray?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Three other operators from the Exeter office are
in the court-room, with a set of instruments and a
battery. Let them place the instruments on the table
down there; blindfold me, then have them and Jack
Orr by turns write something on the key. I&#8217;ll identify
every one of them before he sends a half-dozen
words.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A wave of surprise, then smiles of incredulity passed
over the crowded room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; agreed the lawyer readily. &#8220;Set up
the instruments.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The three Exeter operators came forward, and the
prosecutor, producing a handkerchief, himself stepped
into the witness-box and proceeded to bind Alex&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
eyes. That done, to make doubly sure, he turned
Alex face to the wall.
</p>
<p>When the lawyer returned to the counsel-table the
proceedings were momentarily interrupted by a whispered
consultation with his assistant, at the end of
which, while the spectators wondered, the latter hastened
from the room.
</p>
<p>Curiosity as to the junior counsel&#8217;s mission was
quickly forgotten, however, as the prosecutor then
called Jack Orr to the table beside the telegraph instruments,
and stood Jack and the three Exeter operators
in a row before him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said he in a low voice, &#8220;each of you, as
I touch you, step quietly to the key, and send these
words: &#8216;Do you know who this is?&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p>A moment the lawyer paused, while spectators,
judge and jury waited in breathless silence, then
reaching out, he lightly touched one of the Exeter
men.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know who this is?&#8221; clicked the sounder.
</p>
<p>All eyes turned toward Alex. Without a moment&#8217;s
hesitation he answered, &#8220;Johnson.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The operator nodded, and a flutter passed over the
court-room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh! A guess,&#8221; declared the prosecutor audibly,
and still smiling confidently, he touched another of the
Exeter operators. The instruments repeated the question.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Bradley,&#8221; said Alex promptly.
</p>
<p>The flutter of surprise was repeated. Quickly the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
prosecutor made as though to touch the third Exeter
man, then abruptly again touched Bradley.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Bradley again,&#8221; said Alex.
</p>
<p>A ripple like applause swept over the crowded room.
With tightening lips the prosecutor turned again
toward the third Exeter operator. At the moment
the door opened, and he paused as his assistant reappeared,
with him two young ladies.
</p>
<p>The newcomers were operators from the local commercial
telegraph office.
</p>
<p>At once Jack&#8217;s lawyer, recognizing the prosecution&#8217;s
purpose, was on his feet in protest. For of course the
young women were utter strangers to the blindfolded
boy in the witness-stand.
</p>
<p>The judge promptly motioned him down, however,
and with a smile of anticipated triumph the prosecutor
greeted the two local operators, and whispering his instructions
to one of them, led her to the telegraph key.
</p>
<p>In a silence that was painful the sounder once more
rattled out its inquiry, &#8220;Do you know who this is?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Alex started, hesitated, made as though to speak,
again paused, then suddenly cried, &#8220;That&#8217;s a stranger!
</p>
<p>&#8220;And it&#8217;s awfully like the light, jumpy sending of
a girl!&#8221;
</p>
<p>A spontaneous cheer broke from the excited spectators.
&#8220;Silence! Silence!&#8221; shouted the judge.
</p>
<p>It was not necessary to repeat the order, for the disconcerted
prosecutor, whirling about, had grasped
Jack Orr by the arm and thrust him toward the key.
</p>
<div class='figcenter'>

<p class='caption' style='text-align:center;'>
&#8220;AND IT&#8217;S AWFULLY LIKE THE LIGHT, JUMPY SENDING OF<br />
A GIRL!&#8221;
<br />
</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span></div>
<p>The final test had come.
</p>
<p>Jack himself realized the significance of the moment,
and for an instant hesitated, trembling. Then determinedly
gripping himself he reached forward, grasped
the key, and sent,
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Orr! Orr! That&#8217;s he!&#8221; cried Alex.
</p>
<p>With a shout the entire court-room was on its feet,
women waving their handkerchiefs and men cheering
wildly again and again. And equally disregarding the
etiquette of the court, Alex tore the handkerchief from
his eyes, and leaping down beside Jack, fell to shaking
his hand as though he would never let go, while Jack
vainly sought to express himself, and to keep back the
tears that came to his eyes.
</p>
<p>Ten minutes later, with order restored, Jack was
formally declared &#8220;Not guilty,&#8221; and with Alex on one
side and his father on the other, left the room, free and
vindicated.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, good-by, my lad,&#8221; said Mr. Orr, as he and
Alex that evening dropped Jack off their returning
train at Midway Junction. &#8220;And I suppose it is unnecessary
to warn you against understandings with
such men as Watts in the future, no matter for what
purpose.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hardly, Dad,&#8221; responded Jack earnestly. &#8220;No
more agreements of any kind for me unless they are
on the levellest kind of level, no matter who they are
with, or for what purpose.&#8221;

<h2>XIII</h2>
<h3>PROFESSOR CLICK, MIND READER</h3>
</div>

<p>Some months previously Alex and Jack had arranged
to take their two weeks&#8217; vacation at the
same time, and to spend one week at Haddowville,
Jack&#8217;s home, and the other at Bixton.
</p>
<p>The long looked-for Monday had at length arrived,
early that morning Jack had joined Alex at Exeter,
and the two boys, aboard the Eastern Mail, were now
well on their way to Haddowville.
</p>
<p>For some minutes Alex&#8217;s part in the animated conversation
of the two chums had waned. Presently,
plucking Jack&#8217;s sleeve, he quietly directed his companion&#8217;s
attention to the double seat across the aisle
of the car.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Jack, watch that soldier&#8217;s fingers,&#8221; he said in a
low voice. &#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The soldier in question, in the uniform of an infantry
regular, sat facing them, beside a stout elderly
gentleman. Opposite the first soldier was a second,
in a similar uniform; and sharing the seat with the
latter, and facing the old gentleman, was a decidedly
pretty young girl.
</p>
<p>It was the first soldier&#8217;s left hand, however, which
attracted the boys&#8217; particular attention. Resting in his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
lap, and partly concealed by a newspaper, the hand was
so doubled that the thumb stood upright. And this
latter member was bobbing and wagging up and down,
now slowly, now quickly, in most curious fashion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps it&#8217;s St. Vitus&#8217; dance,&#8221; ventured Jack.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But that affects the whole body, or at least the
whole limb, doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jack, who sat next the window, leaned slightly forward.
&#8220;The other soldier is watching him,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Maybe the fellow with the wiggling thumb is out
of his mind, and this one is taking him somewhere.
He is watching his hand.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Silently the boys continued to regard the curious
proceeding.
</p>
<p>Suddenly the thumb became quiet, there was the
rattle of a paper in the hands of the second soldier,
and in turn his thumb became affected with the wagging.
In a moment the boys understood.
</p>
<p>The two soldiers were army signallers, and were
carrying on a silent conversation, using their thumbs
as they would a flag.
</p>
<p>Jack and Alex looked at one another and laughed
softly. &#8220;We&#8217;re bright, eh?&#8221; Alex remarked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us watch when the other starts again&mdash;we
can&#8217;t see this chap&#8217;s hand well enough&mdash;and see if we
can&#8217;t read it,&#8221; suggested Jack. &#8220;That one-flag signal
system is based on the telegraph dot and dash code,
you know. And it&#8217;s not likely they are speaking of
anything private&mdash;only amusing themselves.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The paper opposite again covered the first soldier&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
hand, and observing closely, after a few minutes the
boys were able to interpret the strokes of the wagging
thumb with ease. They corresponded precisely to the
strokes of a telegraph sounder, and of course were very
much slower.
</p>
<p>&#8220;... not much. I saw her first,&#8221; they read.
&#8220;You have three girls at K now.... Get out. I&#8217;ll
tell Maggie O&#8217;Rorke, and she&#8217;ll pick your eyes
out.... No, sir. You can have the two old maids
just back of you, and the fat party with the red
hair. That&#8217;s your taste anyway.... If you spoke
she&#8217;d freeze you so you&#8217;d never thaw out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The two boys exchanged glances, and chuckled in
amusement.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, look at the gaudy nose on that old chap across
the aisle,&#8221; went on the wagging thumb. &#8220;Talk about
danger signals! They ought to hire him to sit on the
cow-catcher foggy nights.... I wouldn&#8217;t like to pay
for all the paint it took to color it.... Plain whiskey,
I guess. You can see what you are coming to if you
don&#8217;t look out.... What&#8217;s the matter with that baby
back there? Is the woman lynching it, or is it lynching
the woman?... It&#8217;s not, either. It&#8217;s just like
your high tenor, singing the Soldier&#8217;s Farewell. Only
better. More in tune.... Yes, if they knew what
we&#8217;d been saying about them there&#8217;d be a riot. I
wouldn&#8217;t give much for your hair when the two old
ladies behind got through with it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>At this point, unable to resist the temptation, Alex
nudged Jack, drew a pencil from his pocket, and slyly
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
tapped on the metal of the seat-arm the two letters of
the telegraph laugh, &#8220;Hi!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The soldier opposite started, looked quickly over,
caught the two boys&#8217; twinkling eyes, and coloring,
laughed heartily. Promptly then he raised his thumb,
and wagged, &#8220;You young rascals! I&#8217;ll have you in
the guard-house for stealing military information.
Who are you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Alex replied, using his thumb as he had seen the
soldier do; and the animated exchange of signals
which followed continued until a whistle from the engine
announced a stop, and the soldier wagged, &#8220;We
get off here. Good-by.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Glad to have met you,&#8221; he said, smiling, as he and
his companion passed them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Glad to have met you,&#8221; responded the boys heartily.
&#8220;And to have got onto the signalling. It may
come in useful some day,&#8221; Alex added. &#8220;Good day.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just what I was thinking myself, Al,&#8221; declared
Jack. &#8220;We must practice it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Following the disappearance of the out-going passengers,
a group of newcomers appeared at the farther
car door.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here comes someone I know,&#8221; Jack observed.
&#8220;The big man in front&mdash;Burke, a real estate agent.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The tall, heavy-featured man passed them and took
the seat immediately behind.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He didn&#8217;t speak to you,&#8221; commented Alex.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad he didn&#8217;t. He&#8217;s no friend; just knew
him, I meant,&#8221; responded Jack. &#8220;He is a proper
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
shark, they say. I know he practically did a widow
out of a bit of property just back of ours.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And here is another, same business, from the next
town. And not much better,&#8221; Jack went on, as a
short, bustling, sharp-featured man appeared.
</p>
<p>The man behind them stood up and called, &#8220;Hi,
there, Mitchell! Here!&#8221; The newcomer waved his
hand, came forward quickly, and also dropped into the
seat at the rear of the two boys.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nice pair of hawks,&#8221; said Jack. &#8220;I&#8217;ll bet they
are hatching up something with a shady side to it. I&#8217;d
be tempted to listen if I could.&#8221;
</p>
<p>As the train was again under way, Jack had no opportunity
of overhearing what was being said behind
them. A few miles farther, however, they came once
more to a stop, and almost immediately he pricked up
his ears and nudged Alex.
</p>
<p>&#8220;... don&#8217;t believe the ignorant dolt knows the real
value of butter and eggs.&#8221; It was the deep voice of
the bigger man, Burke. &#8220;He&#8217;s one of those queer
ducks, without any friends. Lives there all by himself,
doesn&#8217;t read the papers, and only comes to town
about once a month. No; there&#8217;s not one chance in
ten of his waking up and getting onto it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You always were a lucky dog,&#8221; declared the other.
&#8220;If you land it you ought to clear fifty thousand inside
of five years.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A hundred. I intend holding for a cold hundred
thousand. There has been talk of the town building
a steam plant already; but water is of course away
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
ahead of that, and they are sure to swing to it. And
this fall is the only one within ten miles of Haddowville.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t I tell you!&#8221; exclaimed Jack in a whisper.
&#8220;Doing somebody out of something, whatever it is.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You might build the plant yourself, and hold the
town up for whatever you wished,&#8221; the second speaker
went on.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I could. But I prefer the ready cash. That
has always been my plan of doing business. No; I
figure on disposing of the farm just as it stands, either
to the town, or a corporation, for an even hundred
thousand.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Does that give you a clue, Jack?&#8221; Alex asked.
</p>
<p>Jack shook his head. At the next remark, however,
he sharply gripped Alex&#8217;s arm.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What fall has the stream there?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Forty feet, and the lake back of it is nearly a mile
long, and a half mile wide.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The rumble of the train again drowned the voices
of the two men, but Jack had heard enough. &#8220;It&#8217;s
old Uncle Joe Potter&mdash;his farm,&#8221; he said with indignation.
&#8220;Now I understand. The old farmer apparently
doesn&#8217;t know its value as an electric power plant
site, and Burke is trying to get hold of it for a song.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us put the old man onto him,&#8221; Alex immediately
suggested.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll talk the matter over with Father, and see
what he says,&#8221; said Jack.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But here comes the good old town,&#8221; he broke off
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
with boyish enthusiasm. &#8220;Look, there is the creek,
and the old swimming-hole at the bend. I&#8217;ll bet I&#8217;ve
been in there a thousand times. And see that spire&mdash;that&#8217;s
our church. Our house is just beyond.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on, let&#8217;s be getting out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Catching up their suitcases, the boys passed down
the aisle. As they halted at the door, they glanced
back and saw that their neighbors of the next seat
were following them. The two men were still talking;
and coming to a stand behind the boys, the latter
caught a further remark from Burke apparently referring
to the Potter farm deal.
</p>
<p>&#8220;... wrote asking him to town this evening,&#8221; he
was saying. &#8220;I&#8217;ll give him a bit of a good time
to-night, and put him up at one of the hotels&mdash;and,
unless something unexpected happens, I&#8217;ll guarantee
I&#8217;ll have the thing put through by noon to-morrow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope you do,&#8221; responded his companion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And I hope you don&#8217;t!&#8221; exclaimed Jack beneath
his breath. &#8220;And I may do something more than
hope.&#8221;
</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Twenty minutes later, after a joyous welcome from
his father and mother, and sister Kate, and the cordial
reception extended Alex, Jack was seated at his &#8220;old
corner&#8221; of the vine-hidden veranda, recounting the
conversation they had overheard between the two real
estate men. Before Mr. Orr had ventured an opinion
in the matter, however, the subject was temporarily
thrust aside by the appearance of a party of Kate&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
girl friends, evidently much disturbed over something.
When on running forward Kate&#8217;s voice was quickly
added to the excited conversation, Jack followed to
greet the girls, and learn the cause, and returned with
the party to the veranda.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now what do you think of this?&#8221; he exclaimed
with tragic horror. &#8220;Professor Robison, the world renowned
mind reader (though I never heard of him
before), owing to his inability to arrive, will not be
able to be present at the Girls&#8217; Club song-fight to-night!
Did you ever!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s no laughing matter,&#8221; said Kate, following
the introduction of her friends to Alex. &#8220;He was the
feature of our program to-night, and I simply can&#8217;t
see what we are going to do. Many of the people
will be coming just to hear him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Jack, couldn&#8217;t you help us out?&#8221; asked one of the
other girls, half seriously. &#8220;You used to pretend you
were a phrenologist and all that kind of thing at
school, I remember.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No thanks, Mary. I&#8217;ve gotten over all that sort
of foolishness,&#8221; Jack responded, expanding his chest
and speaking in a deep voice. &#8220;I leave that for you
younger folks.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A small laughing riot followed this pompous declaration,
and at its conclusion Jack carried Alex off to
introduce him to his pigeons and chickens, and other
former treasures of the back yard.
</p>
<p>Some minutes later Jack was dilating on the rich
under-color of his pet Buff Orpington hen, when Alex,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
with an apology, abruptly broke in. &#8220;Say, Jack, what
kind of a crowd do they have at these Girls&#8217; Club affairs?
Very swell?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, about everyone in the church goes, and quite
a few farmers usually come in from out of town.
They are as &#8216;swell&#8217; as anything we have here, I guess.
The Sunday-school room is usually well filled.
Why?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was just wondering whether we <i>couldn&#8217;t</i> help
the girls out, and have a little fun out of it into the
bargain. Remember the soldiers on the train? Now,
why couldn&#8217;t we,&#8221; and therewith Alex briefly sketched
his plan. Jack promptly tossed the hen back into the
coop. &#8220;Great, Al! We will! It will be all kinds of
a lark. I think there is just the stuff we&#8217;ll need up
in the garret.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on; we&#8217;ll break the joyful tidings to the
girls.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d rather you played the part, though,&#8221; said Alex
as they returned toward the veranda. &#8220;You of
course know everyone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That will make no difference according to this
plan. If I am in full view, too, that will add to the
mystery, and help keep up the fun. The folks will be
breaking their heads to learn who it is on the platform.
No; it&#8217;s settled. You are the distinguished
professor and phreno-what-do-you-call-it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girls on the veranda were still in dejected debate
as the boys reappeared. &#8220;Ladies, we&#8217;ve got this
thing fixed for you,&#8221; announced Jack. &#8220;We have just
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
wirelessed and engaged that world-famous thought-stealer,
bumpologist and general seer, Prof. Mahomet
Click, of Constantinople, to plug up that hole in your
program to-night. He stated that it would give him
great pleasure to come to the assistance of such charming
young women, et cetera, and that he could be
counted upon.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You two mean things!&#8221; exclaimed Kate. &#8220;We
saw you with your heads together out there, laughing.
This is no joking matter at all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We are serious,&#8221; Jack protested. &#8220;Positively.
You go ahead and announce that owing to an attack
of croup, or any other reason, Prof. Robison will not
be able to appear, but that Prof. Click has kindly
consented to substitute, and we will look after the
rest.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you really mean it?&#8221; cried the girls.
</p>
<p>&#8220;On our word as full-grown gentlemen,&#8221; responded
Jack. &#8220;But we&#8217;re not going to explain.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on, Alex, until we have further debate with
the distinguished Turk up in the garret. He probably
has arrived by this time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Whatever doubts Kate had as to the seriousness of
the boys&#8217; intentions, they had not only been dissipated
by noon, but had given place to lively curiosity and
expectation. Alex and Jack had devoted the entire
morning to their mysterious preparations; had made
numerous trips to the church school-room, to the
stores; had borrowed needles, thread, mucilage; had
turned the library shelves upside-down in a search for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
certain books; and once, coming on them unawares,
she had surprised them practising strange incantations
with their fingers.
</p>
<p>It was late in the afternoon that the serious, and
what was to prove the most important, feature of the
evening&#8217;s performance developed. On a return trip
to the dry-goods store Jack drew Alex to a halt with
an exclamation, and pointed across the street. Burke,
the real estate man, was walking slowly along with a
shrivelled-up little old gentleman in dilapidated hat,
faded garments, and top-boots.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The victim!&#8221; said Jack with deep disgust. &#8220;Old
Uncle Joe Potter.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Look at him sporting along with a cigar in his
mouth&mdash;one of Burke&#8217;s cigars!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The boys parallelled the oddly assorted pair some
distance, and it could readily be seen that Burke was
doing his best to win the old man&#8217;s confidence, and
that the latter already was much impressed with the
attention and deference shown him by the well-dressed
agent.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If we could get the old man alone,&#8221; said Alex.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not much chance, I am afraid. Now that he has
him in hand, Burke probably won&#8217;t lose sight of him
until he has closed his bargain. Remember what he
said just before we left the train, about giving the old
chap a good time to-night, and putting him up at one
of the hotels.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Alex halted. &#8220;Give him a good time! Say, Jack,
why shouldn&#8217;t he give him a good time at the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
Girls&#8217; Club entertainment to-night? And then why
shouldn&#8217;t we&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jack uttered a shout, and struck Alex enthusiastically
on the back. &#8220;Al, you&#8217;ve hit it! You&#8217;ve hit it!
Bully!
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here! Give me those complimentary tickets Kate
gave us, and I&#8217;ll go right after them, before they make
any other arrangements. You wait.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jack was running across the street in a moment,
and drawing up alongside the two men, he addressed
them both. &#8220;Excuse me, Mr. Potter, Mr. Burke&mdash;but
wouldn&#8217;t you like to take in our Girls&#8217; Club entertainment
to-night? It&#8217;s going to be really quite
good&mdash;good music, and fun, and a bit of tea
social in between.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure you would enjoy it,&#8221; he declared, addressing
himself to the older man. &#8220;One of the features
of the program is a chap who claims he can read
people&#8217;s thoughts. Of course nobody thinks he can,
but he will make lots of fun.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The old man smiled, and looked at his companion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is up to you, Mr. Potter,&#8221; responded Burke
genially. &#8220;If you think you would enjoy it, why, I
would. Your taste is good enough recommendation
for me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then let us go,&#8221; said the old gentleman, putting
his hand into his pocket.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; this is my treat,&#8221; interposed Burke, grasping
the tickets. &#8220;Here you are, lad, and keep the
change.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, sir,&#8221; said Jack. And with difficulty
restraining a shout, he dashed back toward Alex, waving
his hat above his head as a token of victory.
</p>
<p>The scene of the Girls&#8217; Club entertainment, the
church school-room, was filled to the doors when the
program began that evening.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m beginning to be anxious about Mr. Burke and
the old man, though,&#8221; observed Jack, who with Alex
had been standing near the entrance, and remarking
on the good attendance. A moment after the door
again opened, and Jack started forward with an expression
of relief. They had come.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good evening, Mr. Potter, Mr. Burke,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Shall I find you a seat?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and a good one, now,&#8221; requested the real
estate man.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I saved two, well to the front,&#8221; responded Jack.
&#8220;This way, please.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Alex,&#8221; he said, returning, &#8220;it&#8217;s up to us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The &#8220;mind-reading&#8221; number on the program was
at length reached. The chairman arose.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am very sorry to say, ladies and gentlemen,&#8221; he
announced, &#8220;that Prof. Robison, who is next on the
program, was unexpectedly not able to keep his engagement.
However, in his place we have secured the
services of Prof. Mahmoud Click, of Constantinople;
astrologer, phrenologist, mind-reader, and general all-round
seer; and I am sure you will find him no less
instructive and entertaining.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Despite this assurance, in the silence which followed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
there was a distinct note of disappointment, even displeasure.
For it was obvious that the flowery title of
the substitute concealed some local amateur.
</p>
<p>Disappointment, however, quickly gave place to a
flutter of interest when the rear door opened, and preceded
by Jack Orr, there swept down the aisle a tall,
venerable figure in flowing robes; white-bearded, spectacled,
and crowned with a tall conical hat bearing
strange hieroglyphics.
</p>
<p>When, on Jack stepping aside and taking an unobtrusive
front seat, the aged professor mounted the
platform and solemnly surveyed his audience, titters,
then a burst of laughter swept over the school-room.
The long yellow robe was covered with grotesque caricatures
of cats, frogs, dogs, cranes and turtles, interspersed
with great black question-marks.
</p>
<p>The famed Oriental turned about toward a table,
and the laughing broke out afresh. In the center of
his back was a large cat&#8217;s-head, with wonderfully
squinting eyes. When the cat slowly closed one distorted
optic in a wink, then smiled, there was an unrestrained
shout of merriment, and those who were
not excitedly inquiring of one another the identity of
the &#8220;seer,&#8221; settled back in their seats expectantly.
</p>
<p>Placing the table at the front of the platform, the
professor again faced the audience, and with dignified
air, and deep, tragic voice, addressed them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ladees and gentlemans. Ze chairman have spoke.
I am Mahmoud Click, ze great seer, ze great mind-read,
ze great bump-read, ze great profess. (Laughter.)
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
I am ze seventeen son, of ze seventeen son, of
ze seventeen son.
</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; also have I bring for do ze magic pass,&#8221;
thrusting a hand within his robe, &#8220;Tom ze Terrible,
ze son of Tom, ze son of Tom.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The hand reappeared, and placed on the table a
tiny black kitten.
</p>
<p>The burst of laughter which greeted this was renewed
when the tiny animal began making playful
passes at a spool on a string which the dignified professor
held before it, remarking, &#8220;See? Ze magic
pass.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now Tom ze Terrible will answer ze question,
and show he onderstan&#8217; ze Ingleesh,&#8221; the magician
announced, at the same time swinging the spool out of
the kitten&#8217;s sight.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tom, how old you are?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The spool was swung back, the kitten began again
hitting at it, solemnly the professor counted to twenty,
and whisked the spool away. &#8220;Twenty year. Correc&#8217;.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You see, ladees and gentlemans, ze venerable cat
he cannot make mistake,&#8221; he observed amid laughing
applause.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now Tom, tell some odder ting. How old is ze
chairman?&#8221; indicating the dignified elderly man at
the farther end of the platform. &#8220;Five? Correc&#8217;.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You see, he always is right, yes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Tom, how old is ze Rev. Mr. Borden?...
Seven? Correc&#8217; again.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span></p>
<p>When the laughter which followed this &#8220;demonstration&#8221;
had subsided the professor took up a new
line. Earlier in the evening a certain John Peters,
one of the town&#8217;s foppish young gallants, and who
now occupied a prominent front seat, had widely announced
the fact that he was present for the express
purpose of &#8220;showing the mind-reader up.&#8221; At him
accordingly the first quip was directed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now Tom, tell ze audience, how many girl
have Mr. John Wilberforce Peters?&#8221; was asked.
&#8220;What? None?&#8221; For, the spool being held out
of sight, the kitten gazed before it stolidly, without
raising a foot. &#8220;Well, how many does he think
he have?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The spool being returned, the kitten tapped it ten
times, paused, and struck it eight more, while the resulting
wave of amusement grew, and the over-dressed
object glowered threateningly at the figure on the
platform.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And how many will he marry?... What? Not
one? Well, well,&#8221; commented the seer, to further
hearty laughter.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now tell us about some of ze young ladies,&#8221; the
professor went on. &#8220;How many beaux has Miss
K. O.?&#8221; While Kate Orr bridled indignantly the
spool was lowered, and the kitten tapped several times
on one side, several times on the other, then, to an
outburst of laughing and clapping, sat up and began
hitting it rapidly with both paws.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was unable to keep ze count,&#8221; announced the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
seer, &#8220;but apparently about ze seventy-five. Miss O.
she is popular wiz ze young men, yes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And now, Tom,&#8221; continued the magician, &#8220;how
many special lady friend have Mr. Kumming (an extremely
bashful member of the choir)?... Twenty-two!
And how many young lady are in ze choir?
Twenty-two!
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah! A strange coincidence,&#8221; observed the learned
professor amid much merriment.
</p>
<p>With similar quips and jokes the mind-reader continued,
then giving the kitten into the charge of a
little girl in a front seat, announced:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now will I read ze head. Will some small boys
please come up and bring their heads and bumps?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Coaxing finally brought a half-dozen grinning
youngsters of eight or ten to the platform. From the
pocket of the last to respond protruded the unmistakable
cover of a dime-novel. Him the professor
seized first, and having gravely examined his head,
announced, &#8220;Ladees and gentlemans, for this boy I
predict a great future. Never have I seen such sign
of literary taste. Yes, he will be great&mdash;unless he
go west to kill ze Indian, and ze Indian see him
first.&#8221;
</p>
<p>On turning to the head of the second boy, the
phrenologist started, looked more sharply, and slowly
straightening up, announced, &#8220;Ladees and gentlemans,
I have made ze great discovery. This boy some
days you will be proud to know. Never have I seen
such a lovely bump&mdash;for eat ze pie! And any kind
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
of pie you will name. He don&#8217;t care. He will eat
it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And so, to continued laughter, he went on, finding
remarkable cake-bumps, holiday-bumps, and picnic-bumps,
and proportionately under-developed school
and chore-bumps&mdash;with the exception of one glowing
example, which finally proved to have been developed
by a baseball bat.
</p>
<p>Then came the &#8220;mind-reading.&#8221; Placing a small
blackboard on the front of the platform, facing the
audience, the professor seated himself in a chair ten
feet behind it, and invited someone to step to the board
and write.
</p>
<p>&#8220;All I ask is,&#8221; announced the mind-reader, &#8220;please
write not too fast, and fix ze mind on what you write.
And by ze thought-wave will I tell it, letter by letter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The first to respond wrote the name of his father,
a doctor. Expecting only some humorous guess as to
what was written, the audience was somewhat surprised
when the professor spelled out the name correctly,
only adding the humorous touch of &#8220;mud,&#8221;
hastily corrected to &#8220;M. D.&#8221; As others followed
with figures, and more difficult names and words, the
interest of the audience began to take on a new tone.
</p>
<p>The last of the first party which had stepped forward
to write was the over-dressed young man Alex
had poked some of his fun at, and who was bent on
&#8220;showing him up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He wrote: &#8220;You are a faker.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Explain to ze audience how I do it, zen, Mr.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
Peters,&#8221; retorted the professor. In some confusion
Peters sought his seat, and the minister approached
the board.
</p>
<p>The interest of the audience had now become serious
and silent. Even Kate Orr, though knowing there
was trickery somewhere, was nonplussed. For Jack,
in the front row, appeared as immovable, and as
frankly interested as those about him. Loosely folded
in his lap was a newspaper which for a moment attracted
Kate&#8217;s suspicious eye; but watching closely,
she saw not the hint of a movement that might have
been a signal.
</p>
<p>The minister&#8217;s first word was the name Hosea.
This was promptly called off, and the writer went on
with others, gradually more difficult. Finally, in
rapid succession, one under the other, he wrote
&#8220;ZEDEKIAH, AHOLIBAH, NEBUCHADNEZZAR.&#8221;
As readily the figure on the platform announced
them, and the reverend gentleman turned
away with an expression frankly puzzled.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Pardon me, Mr. Professor, but since this is genuine
mind-reading, of course you could read just as
well with your eyes blindfolded, could you not?
Would you kindly give a demonstration that way?&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was Peters. There was immediate clapping at
the suggestion, and calls of &#8220;Yes, yes! Do it blindfolded!&#8221;
</p>
<p>In alarm Kate, from her seat, gazed toward Jack.
To her surprise he was one of the most energetic in
clapping the proposal.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span></p>
<p>The professor himself, however, was plainly disconcerted,
to the particular delight of Peters and his circle
of friends, who, as the mind-reader continued to hesitate,
clapped more and more loudly.
</p>
<p>Finally the seer arose. &#8220;Well, ladees and gentlemans,
if you wish, certainly. Though I do read just
as good with my eyes open.&#8221;
</p>
<p>This negative statement brought further derisive
laughter and clapping from Peters and his friends,
which was added to when the professor continued,
&#8220;Will some young lady be kind enough to lend me
ze handkerchief&mdash;ze tiny leetle one with plenty holes
all round?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Peters was again on his feet. &#8220;Here is one!&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was a large, dark neckerchief, obviously brought
for this very purpose. As Peters stepped forward and
mounted the platform the professor removed his spectacles
with apparent reluctance. Broadly smiling, Peters
threw the folded kerchief over the mind-reader&#8217;s
eyes, saw that it fitted snugly, and tied it. &#8220;Now
we&#8217;ve got you, Mr. Smart, of Constantinople,&#8221; he
whispered derisively.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have ze good time and laugh while you may,&#8221;
responded the professor, and raising his voice he asked,
&#8220;Will someone kindly bring ze glass water? Mind-reading,
it is dry.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was Jack started to his feet, passed down the
room, and returned with the desired water. Watching,
Kate expected to see a consultation between the
two boys, as to some way out of the apparent difficulty.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
Jack, however, merely placed the glass in the extended
hand, and received it back without the exchange of
a syllable. Not only that, he returned to the back of
the hall, and instead of resuming his seat at the front,
mounted to a window ledge at the rear.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I am ready,&#8221; announced the professor.
&#8220;And I make ze suggestion that Mr. Peters himself
write ze first.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The latter was speedily at the board. As he wrote,
a silence fell. Previously the professor had called off
each letter as written. This time there was no response.
With a smile that gradually broadened to a
laugh Peters finished an odd Indian name, and asked,
&#8220;The thought-waves haven&#8217;t gone astray already, have
they, Mr. Professor? Haven&#8217;t been frightened off
by a mere handkerchief, surely?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was wondering how to pronounce it,&#8221; came the
quiet response. &#8220;I&#8217;ll spell it instead. It is,
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;M U S Q U O D O B O I T.&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Peters stared blankly. Not more blankly than the
majority of the audience, however, including Kate herself.
She turned toward Jack. He appeared as surprised
as Peters. Indeed, if there was anything suspicious,
it was that Jack appeared a trifle over-astonished.
</p>
<p>As the burst of applause which followed the first
surprise was succeeded by a wave of laughter, Kate
turned back to discover Peters, very red in the face,
drawing on the board a picture. As she looked a
grotesquely ugly face took shape. The face completed,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
there was a renewed burst of merriment when
Peters topped it with a fool&#8217;s-cap, and on that sketched
rough hieroglyphics.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now whose picture have I drawn?&#8221; he demanded
loudly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you tried to draw mine,&#8221; responded the professor,
dropping into normal English, &#8220;but as the
dunce&#8217;s tie is far up the back of his collar, I leave the
audience to decide whose it is.&#8221;
</p>
<p>At this there were shouts and shrieks of laughter,
and Peters, hurriedly feeling, and finding his own tie
far out of place, threw the chalk to the floor and
dashed back to his seat amid a perfect bedlam of
hilarity.
</p>
<p>The uproar soon subsided, however, for not one in
the crowded room but was now thoroughly wonderstruck
at the demonstration. Some of the older people
began to step forward, writing the most difficult
names they could think of, meaningless words, groups
of figures. A teacher chalked a proposition in algebra.
Without error all were called out promptly.
</p>
<p>The climax was reached when one of the church
elders advanced to the board, and while writing, fixed
his eyes on something in his half-opened hand.
</p>
<p>Without hesitation the blindfolded unknown announced,
&#8220;Mr. Storey is writing the name of one of
the Apostles, but is thinking of a penknife.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The clapping which followed was scattered and
brief. &#8220;It&#8217;s simply uncanny,&#8221; exclaimed one of
Kate&#8217;s neighbors. Kate, glancing back toward Jack,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
shook her head. Up there, in full view, she could not
possibly see how he could have anything to do with
it.
</p>
<p>At this point the minister again stepped forward.
&#8220;Will you answer a few questions?&#8221; he scrawled.
</p>
<p>&#8220;With pleasure, Mr. Borden.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How old am I?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Forty-nine next September.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The minister ran his fingers through his hair, perplexedly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How old is Mrs. Borden?&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was a slight pause, then in gallant tones came
the answer, &#8220;Twenty-two.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Amid a renewal of laughter, and much clapping
from the ladies, the minister was about to turn away,
when on second thought he turned back, and wrote:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Name the twelve Apostles.&#8221;
</p>
<p>For the first time the learned seer displayed signs
of uneasiness. After some stumbling, however, he
completed the list.
</p>
<p>With a twinkle in his eyes, the preacher inscribed
a second question, &#8220;Name Joshua&#8217;s captains.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Prof. Click cleared his throat, ran his fingers down
his beard, moved uneasily in his chair, and at length,
while a smile began to spread over the room, shook
his head.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I am thinking of them&mdash;hard,&#8221; declared the
minister, chuckling.
</p>
<p>The professor was again about to shake his head,
when suddenly he paused, then replied boldly, &#8220;Shem,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
Ham, Hezekiah, Hittite, Peter, Goliath, Solomon and
Pharaoh.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was during the shouts of merriment following
this ridiculous response that Kate&#8217;s mystification began
to dissolve. Glancing again toward her brother, she
saw that, despite a show of laughing, there was an
uneasiness in his face similar to that shown by the
professor. And when presently she saw him cast a
covertly longing eye toward a pile of Bibles in the
next window, she turned back to the platform, silently
laughing. She thought she had discovered the source
of the &#8220;thought waves.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The success of the brazenly invented answer to the
last question, meantime, had quite restored the professor&#8217;s
confidence, and as the minister went on, he
continued to respond in the same ridiculous fashion,
claiming, on the minister&#8217;s protest, that he was only
reading the thought-waves as they came to him. And
finally the pastor laughingly gave it up.
</p>
<p>At the next, and final, &#8220;demonstration&#8221; mystification
of another kind came to the observant Kate. Rising
to his feet, the mind-reader announced that he
would now inform a few of the &#8220;stronger thinkers&#8221;
before him the subject of their thoughts; and both in
his manner and tone Kate noted an unmistakable nervousness.
Glancing toward Jack, she saw that his face
also was grave, and with a stirring of apprehension of
she knew not what, she waited.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The first thought which reaches me,&#8221; began the
professor, &#8220;is from Miss Mary Andrews. Miss Andrews
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
thinks her pretty toque is on straight. It&#8217;s not
quite. I think one pin is coming out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Following this laughingly applauded &#8220;reading,&#8221; the
speaker informed Miss James that she was thinking
her lace collar was not loose behind. &#8220;Which was
quite correct.&#8221; As also was Mr. Storey&#8217;s impression
that there was not a long blond hair on his coat collar.
&#8220;There was not.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then Kate distinctly saw the speaker take a deep
breath.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Joseph Potter is a strong thinker,&#8221; he proceeded.
&#8220;I read several thoughts from Mr. Potter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The old farmer, to whom the whole performance
had appeared as nothing less than magic, leaned out
into the aisle, breathless and staring.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems to me, Mr. Potter,&#8221; the mind-reader
went on, &#8220;it seems to me you are thinking about some
important business deal&mdash;some big deal concerning
land.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The old man&#8217;s mouth opened.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Also it seems to me that this land may be worth
a great deal more than&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was an exclamation, a commotion, and
Burke, the real estate man, was on his feet. A moment
he stood staring, as though doubting his ears, then
catching up his hat he said in a loud voice, &#8220;Come,
Mr. Potter, we must go. That other engagement, you
know&mdash;I had forgotten it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The old man sprang up, and brushed Burke aside.
&#8220;Go on! Go on!&#8221; he cried toward the figure on the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
platform. The startled audience gazed from one to
another. Several arose.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems to me,&#8221; resumed Alex quietly, &#8220;that
there is a waterfall on your farm, and that&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold on there! Hold on!&#8221; The words came in
a shout, and springing into the aisle, Burke strode
toward the platform, purple with rage. &#8220;What do
you mean? What are you doing?
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is this man?&#8221; he demanded at the top of
his lungs. &#8220;I demand to know! What does he mean
by&mdash;?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Swiftly hobbling down the aisle behind him, the old
man attempted to pass. Roughly Burke pushed him
back.
</p>
<p>The minister stepped forward. &#8220;Mr. Burke, what
do you mean?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What does this man here mean by&mdash;by&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, by what, Mr. Burke?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;By making reflections against me,&#8221; shouted Burke.
&#8220;I demand an explanation! I&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But my dear sir, I am sure nothing was said&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>The old man dodged by, ran to the edge of the
platform, and cried in a thin, high voice, &#8220;Do you
mean my farm? My farm that Burke wants to
buy?&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was a momentary silence, during which here
and there could be heard long in-drawn gasps. Then
abruptly Alex tore the bandage from his eyes, swept
off the hat and beard, and stepped to the front.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There need be no further mystery about this,&#8221; he
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
declared in a grimly steady voice. &#8220;On the train this
morning Jack Orr and I accidentally overheard&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>From Burke came a scream, he sprang forward with
raised fists, faltered, and suddenly whirling about,
dashed down the aisle for the door, and out. And in
the breathless silence which followed Alex completed
his explanation.
</p>
<p>As the old man climbed the platform steps and
extended a shaking hand, the applause that burst from
every corner of the room fairly rattled the windows;
and as the uproar continued, and Alex sprang hastily
to the floor, he was surrounded by a jostling, enthusiastic
crowd of strangers from whom in vain he sought
to escape.
</p>
<p>Some minutes later, enjoying tea and cake in a
circle which included the minister, the latter smilingly
remarked, &#8220;But you haven&#8217;t yet explained the rest of
the mysterious doings, Master Alex. Aren&#8217;t you going
to enlighten us all round? Prefer to keep it a
secret, eh? Well, if you will promise us another
&#8216;exposition&#8217; I&#8217;m sure we will agree not to press you,&#8221;
declared the minister, heartily.
</p>
<p>And as a matter of fact, save Kate, no one has yet
solved the mystery, not even the janitor, although on
cutting the grass a few days later he picked up beneath
one of the school-room windows an unaccountable
piece of fine copper wire.

<h2>XIV</h2>
<h3>THE LAST OF THE FREIGHT THIEVES</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;No; I&#8217;m not after you this time,&#8221; laughingly
responded Detective Boyle to Jack&#8217;s half serious
inquiry on recognizing his visitor at the station
one evening a month later as the road detective who
on the previous memorable occasion had called in
company with the sheriff. &#8220;Instead, I want your
assistance.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know,&#8221; he asked, seating himself, &#8220;that
your friends the freight thieves are operating again
on the division?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; said Jack in surprise.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They are. And they have evolved some scheme
that is more baffling even than the &#8216;haunting&#8217; trick
you spoiled for them here last spring. Every week
they are getting away with valuable stuff from one
of the night freights between Claxton and Eastfield,
while the train is actually en route, apparently. That
sounds incredible, I know, but it is the only possible
conclusion to come to, since the train does not stop
between those places, and I made sure the goods each
time were aboard when it left Claxton.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jack whistled. &#8220;That does look a problem, doesn&#8217;t
it! But where do I come in, Mr. Boyle?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Last evening, while thinking the matter over, the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
trick the thieves used here at the Junction recurred to
me&mdash;the man shipped in a box. It came to me:
Why couldn&#8217;t that same dodge be played back against
them in this case?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I see! Have yourself shipped in a box, and
&#8216;stolen&#8217; by them! Clever idea,&#8221; exclaimed Jack.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not so bad I think, myself. Well, in the country
between Claxton and Eastfield, where it is my theory
the gang has its headquarters, there are no telephone
or telegraph lines, and it struck me it would be a good
plan to take someone along with me who in case of
things going wrong could make his way back to the
railroad, and cut in on the wire and call for help. And
naturally you were the first one I thought of. Do
you want the job?&#8221; asked the detective.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d jump at the chance,&#8221; Jack agreed eagerly.
&#8220;It&#8217;d be more fun than enough.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Mr. Boyle, how do you know that the boxes
are taken to the freight thieves&#8217; headquarters, unopened,
and not broken into right at the railroad?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I figure that out from the number and size of the
packages they have taken each time&mdash;just a good load
for a light wagon. And anyway you can see that that
would be their safest plan. If they broke up boxes
near the track they would leave clues that would be
sure to be found sooner or later, and put us on their
trail.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And through a friend in the wholesale dry-goods
business at Claxton, who I&#8217;ll see down there to-night,&#8221;
the detective went on, &#8220;I can make practically sure
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
of our being &#8216;stolen&#8217; together. The thieves have
shown a partiality for his goods; and by having our
boxes attractively labelled &#8216;SILK,&#8217; and placed just
within the car door, there will be little chance of the
robbers passing us by.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My plan is to bring it off to-morrow night.
Would that suit you?&#8221; concluded the detective.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir. That is, if I can get away. For it will
take all night, I suppose?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. There will be no trouble about your getting
off, though. I spoke to Allen before I came down,&#8221;
said Boyle, rising. &#8220;All right, it is arranged. You
take the five-thirty down to-morrow evening, with
the necessary instruments, and I&#8217;ll be at the station
to meet you. Good night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>As Boyle had promised, Jack had no difficulty in
arranging to be off duty the following night, and early
that evening he alighted from the train at Claxton, to
find the railroad detective awaiting him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The instruments, eh?&#8221; queried Boyle, indicating
a parcel under Jack&#8217;s arm as they left the station.
&#8220;Yes, sir; and I have some wire and a file in my
pocket.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the ticket. And everything here is arranged
nicely. We will head for the warehouse at
once.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s the other &#8216;bolt of silk,&#8217; Mr. Brooke,&#8221; the
detective announced a few minutes later as they entered
the office adjoining a large brick building. &#8220;All
ready for us?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Hn! He&#8217;s a pretty small &#8216;bolt,&#8217; isn&#8217;t he?&#8221; commented
the merchant, eyeing Jack with some surprise.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A trifle; but he makes up for size in quality,&#8221;
declared the detective, while Jack blushed. &#8220;He is the
youngster who solved the &#8216;ghost&#8217; riddle and spoiled
this same gang&#8217;s game at Midway Junction.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The merchant warmly shook Jack&#8217;s hand. &#8220;I&#8217;m
glad to meet you, my boy,&#8221; he said. &#8220;After that, I
can readily believe what Boyle says.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I am all ready. This way, please,&#8221; he requested.
</p>
<p>Following the speaker, Jack and the detective found
themselves in a large shipping-room. As they entered,
a workman with a pot and ink-brush in his hand was
surveying lettering he had just completed on a good-sized
packing-case.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here are the &#8216;goods,&#8217; Judson,&#8221; announced the
merchant.
</p>
<p>&#8220;All ready, sir,&#8221; the workman responded, eyeing
Jack and the detective curiously.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you substitute boards with knot-holes?&#8221; Mr.
Brooke asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir. And this is the door,&#8221; said the man,
indicating two wide boards at one end. &#8220;I used both
wooden buttons and screw-hooks on the inside, as you
suggested.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The detective examined the box. &#8220;You&#8217;ve made
a good job of it,&#8221; he commented.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose this is the boy&#8217;s?&#8221; he added, turning to
a smaller box, on which also were the words: &#8220;SILK&mdash;VALUABLE!&#8221;
</p>
<p>With lively interest Jack examined the case.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Get in and let us see how it fits,&#8221; suggested the
merchant. Jack did so.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Fine,&#8221; he announced. &#8220;I could ride all night in
it, easily&mdash;either sitting, or lying down curled up on
my side.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Detective Boyle glanced at his watch. &#8220;You may
as well stay right there, Jack,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We will
start just as soon as the wagon is ready.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s ready now. Judson, go and bring the dray
around,&#8221; the merchant directed.
</p>
<p>As the man left, the detective produced and handed
Jack a small pocket revolver. &#8220;Here, take this, Jack,&#8221;
said he. &#8220;I hope you&#8217;ll not have to use it, but we
must take all precautions.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now to box you in.&#8221; So saying the detective
fitted the &#8220;door&#8221; of Jack&#8217;s box into place, and Jack
on the inside secured it with the hooks and wooden
buttons, and announced &#8220;O K.&#8221; The detective then
entered his own box, and with the merchant&#8217;s assistance
closed the opening. As he tested it there was a
rattle of wheels without, and the big door rumbled
open.
</p>
<p>A few minutes later the two boxes of &#8220;valuable
silk&#8221; had been slid out onto the truck, and the first
stage of the strange journey had begun.
</p>
<p>As planned, it was dusk when the two boxes
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
reached the freight depot. The station agent himself
met them. &#8220;Everything O K, Boyle?&#8221; he whispered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;O K. Place us right before the door, with the lettering
out,&#8221; the detective directed. The agent did as
requested, and with a final &#8220;Good luck!&#8221; closed and
sealed the car door just as the clanging of a bell announced
the approach of an engine. A crash and a
jar told the two unsuspected travelers that their car
had been coupled, there was a whistle, a rumble, a
clanking over switch-points&mdash;and they were on their
way.
</p>
<p>The wheels had been drumming over the rail-joints
for perhaps half an hour, and the disappearance of the
light which had filtered through the car door had announced
the fall of darkness, when there came a
screeching of brakes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where do you suppose we are now, Mr. Boyle?&#8221;
asked Jack from his box.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the grade just north of Axford Road. When
we hit the up-grade two miles beyond we may begin
to expect something. It was along there I figured that
the&mdash;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Both listened. &#8220;One of the brakemen, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;
suggested Jack.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is he doing down on the edge of the car
roof?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The next sound was of something slapping against
the car door.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span></p>
<p>Suddenly the detective gave vent to a cry that was
barely suppressed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Jack, I&#8217;ve got it! I&#8217;ve got it at last!&#8221; he whispered
excitedly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The freight thieves have bought up one of the
brakemen! He lets himself down to the car door by
a rope, opens it, and throws the stuff out!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jack&#8217;s exclamation of delight at this final revelation
of the heart of the mystery was followed by one of
consternation. &#8220;But won&#8217;t we get an awful shaking
up if we&#8217;re pitched off, going at full speed?&#8221; he said
in alarm.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We may. We&#8217;ll have to take it. It&#8217;s all in the
game you know,&#8221; declared Boyle grimly. &#8220;Sit tight
and brace hard, and it&#8217;ll not be so bad, though.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sh! Here he is!&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was a sound of feet scraping against the car
door, a rattle as the seal was broken and the clasp
freed, then a rumble and the sudden full roar of the
train told the two in the boxes that the door had been
opened.
</p>
<p>Swinging within, the intruder closed the door behind
him, and lit a match. Peering from a knot-hole,
Jack saw that the detective&#8217;s guess was correct. It
was a brakeman.
</p>
<p>As Jack watched, the man produced and lit a dark-lantern,
and turned it on the cases before him. Jack
held his breath as the light streamed through the cracks
of his own box.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just to order,&#8221; muttered the brakeman audibly.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And the bigger one, too. I&#8217;ll not have to haul any
out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then, to Jack&#8217;s momentary alarm, then amusement,
the man seated himself on the box, above him.
</p>
<p>Presently, as Jack was wondering what the trainman
was waiting for, from the distant engine came
the two long and two short toots for a crossing, and
the man started to his feet. With his eye to the knot-hole
Jack watched.
</p>
<p>Again came a whistle, and the creaking of brakes.
Immediately the brakeman slid the car door back a
few inches, flashed his lantern four times, muffled it,
and ran the door open its full width.
</p>
<p>The critical moment had come. Gathering himself
together, Jack braced with knees and elbows. The
trainman seized the box, swung it to the door, and
tipped it forward. The next instant Jack felt himself
hurled out into the darkness.
</p>
<p>For one terrible moment he felt himself hurtling
through space. Then came a crackle of branches, the
box whirled over and over, again plunged downward,
and brought up with a crash.
</p>
<p>A brief space Jack lay dazed, in a heap, head down.
But he had been only slightly stunned, and recovering,
he righted himself, and found with satisfaction that he
had suffered no more than a bruise of the scalp and
an elbow.
</p>
<p>He had not long to speculate on his whereabouts.
From near at hand came a sound of breaking twigs,
and a voice.
</p>

THE NEXT INSTANT JACK FELT HIMSELF HURLED OUT INTO<br />
THE DARKNESS.
<br />
</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s one,&#8221; it said.
</p>
<p>Only with difficulty did Jack avoid betraying himself.
It was the voice of the man &#8220;Watts&#8221;!
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; inquired a second voice.
</p>
<p>Through a crack a light appeared. &#8220;Silk,&#8221; announced
Watts.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A good weight, too,&#8221; he added, tipping the box.
&#8220;Catch hold.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The packing-case was caught up; and rocked and
jolted, Jack felt himself carried for what he judged
a full quarter-mile. As the men slowed up a gleam of
moonlight showed through the knot-hole, and peering
forth he discovered a tree-lined road, and a two-horse
wagon.
</p>
<p>Sliding the box into the rear of the wagon, and well
to the front, the men disappeared. The wait that
followed was to Jack the most trying experience
of the evening. Had the detective safely landed?
Was there not a possibility of the larger box having
been shattered? Or sufficiently broken to
reveal its true contents, and disclose the plot to
the freight-robbers? And what then would be his
fate?
</p>
<p>These and many other disquieting possibilities
passed through Jack&#8217;s mind, causing him several times
as the minutes went by to finger the hooks and buttons
which would permit of his escape. Finally snapping
twigs, then heavy, stumbling footfalls allayed his anxiety,
and the two men reappeared, staggering under the
box containing the officer.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span></p>
<p>With difficulty the unsuspecting thieves raised the
heavy packing-case to the tail-board of the wagon.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t go in,&#8221; said Watts&#8217; companion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Push this way a little,&#8221; Watts directed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t&mdash;<i>Look out!</i>&#8221; There was a scramble, and
the box crashed to the ground. At the same moment
came a muffled exclamation, and Jack caught his
breath. Was it the detective? If so, had the others
overheard it?
</p>
<p>With relief, however, he heard Watts, who apparently
was the chief of the gang, call his companion
a mule, and order him to catch hold again. The box
this time was successfully slid aboard; and at once
the two men climbed to the seat, and the wagon rumbled
off.
</p>
<p>As they rattled along over a badly-kept road Jack
gave as close attention to the passing scenery as his
limited view permitted, in order that he might be able
to find his way back to the railroad if it should prove
necessary. This did not promise to be difficult. On
either side the dim moonlight showed an unbroken
succession of trees, and also that the robbers were
continuing in one direction&mdash;apparently due south.
</p>
<p>For what seemed at least two miles they proceeded.
Then appeared a small clearing, and with a quickening
of the pulse Jack felt the wagon slow up and turn
in. They were at their destination.
</p>
<p>A forbiddingly suitable place for its purpose it was.
Standing out darkly on the crest of a rise two hundred
yards back, was a low shanty-like house, in which appeared
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
a single gleam of light. Between, to the road,
stretched a desolate moonlit prospect of stumps, decaying
logs and brush-piles. On either side the woods
formed a towering wall of blackness.
</p>
<p>Rocking and pitching, the wagon made its way up
a rutty, corkscrew lane. They reached the house, and
the door opened, and a tall, unpleasant-looking woman
appeared and greeted the men.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good luck, eh?&#8221; she remarked briefly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure. Don&#8217;t we always have good luck?&#8221; responded
Watts. &#8220;Is supper ready?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. You-uns better come in before you opens
them boxes,&#8221; said the woman.
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Passing on, the wagon came at last to a halt before
a good-sized barn. The two men leaped to the ground,
and while one of them opened the large side doors the
other proceeded to back the wagon to it.
</p>
<p>As the two freight thieves then unhooked, and led
their horses to the stable, there came to Jack&#8217;s ears
a welcome tapping. &#8220;Are you all right, lad?&#8221; whispered
the detective.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, O K, sir, though a bit nervous,&#8221; Jack acknowledged.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep cool and we&#8217;ll soon have them where we
want them. As they are going in to supper first we&#8217;ll
not leave the boxes till then. That&#8217;ll give us just the
opportunity we want to look around and arrange
things nicely.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sh! Here they come!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Catch hold,&#8221; said Watts. Jack heard the detective&#8217;s
box slide out, an &#8220;Up!&#8221; from Watts, the staggering
steps of the men across the barn floor, and a
thud as the box was dropped.
</p>
<p>At what then immediately followed Jack for a
moment doubted his senses. It was the voice of Watts
saying quietly and coldly, &#8220;Now my clever friend in
the box, kindly come out!&#8221;
</p>
<p>They <i>had</i> heard Boyle&#8217;s exclamation when the box
had fallen!
</p>
<p>Scarcely breathing, Jack listened. Would the detective
give himself up without a&mdash;
</p>
<p>There was a muffled report, instantly a second,
louder, then silence.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you come out now?&#8221; demanded Watts.
</p>
<p>To Jack&#8217;s horror there was no response. Watts repeated
the order, then called on his companion for an
axe, and there followed the sound of blows and splintering
wood.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now haul him out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Terror-stricken, Jack listened. Suddenly there
came the sound of a scramble, then of a terrific struggle.
</p>
<p>The detective was all right! It had been only a
ruse! Uttering a suppressed hurrah Jack began hurriedly
undoing the fastenings of his door, to get out to
the detective&#8217;s assistance. Before he had opened it,
however, there was the sound of a heavy fall, and a
triumphant shout from Watts. Promptly Jack paused,
debated a moment, and restored the fastenings. He
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
would wait. Perhaps they would bind Boyle and leave
him in the barn.
</p>
<p>A moment later Jack regretted his decision.
Through the knot-hole he saw the detective led by, his
arms bound behind him, and one of the freight-robbers
on either side.
</p>
<p>The voices and footsteps died away in the direction
of the house, and Jack fell to wondering what he
should do. Before he had decided he heard the voices
of the men returning. Apprehensively he waited.
Had they any suspicion of his presence in the second
packing-case?
</p>
<p>While he held his breath and grimly clutched his
revolver, they slid his box to the rear of the wagon,
lifted it out, and deposited it on the barn floor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Going to have a look at it? Make sure it hasn&#8217;t
some live stock in it too?&#8221; inquired the second
man.
</p>
<p>Jack&#8217;s heart stood still.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; it&#8217;s all right,&#8221; declared Watts confidently.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll have supper first.&#8221; And to Jack&#8217;s unspeakable
relief they passed out and closed the barn door.
Listening until from the house had come the slamming
of a door, Jack once more freed the fastenings within
the box, slipped the board aside, again listened a moment,
and crawled forth.
</p>
<p>As he stood stretching his cramped limbs, he glanced
about. A tier of what looked like bolts of cloth in
the moonlight beneath one of the barn windows caught
his eye. He stepped over.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span></p>
<p>It was silk&mdash;silk such as he had seen in the warehouse
at Claxton!
</p>
<p>Instantly there came to Jack a startling suggestion.
As quickly he decided to act upon it. &#8220;They may
never &#8216;catch on,&#8217;&#8221; he told himself delightedly, &#8220;and
in any case it will give me a good start back for the
railroad, for help.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Glancing from the barn window, to make sure all
was quiet in the direction of the house, he drew his
box into the moonlight, took out the parcel containing
the telegraph instruments, and proceeded to remove
the hooks and buttons, and all other signs of the
&#8220;door.&#8221; Then quickly he filled the box with bolts of
silk from the pile beneath the window.
</p>
<p>That done, he found a hammer and nails, and muffling
the hammer with his handkerchief, as quietly
as possible nailed the boards into place. Triumphantly
he slid the box to its former position on the
floor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that will fool you, Mr. Watts,&#8221; he said
with a smile, and catching up the telegraph instruments
he turned to the door.
</p>
<p>On the threshold he started back. The two men,
and two others, were returning from the house.
</p>
<p>In alarm Jack looked about for a way of escape.
Across the barn was a smaller door. He ran for it
on tiptoe, darted through, and found himself in the
stable. Passing quietly on to the outer door, which
the cracks and moonlight revealed, he waited until the
four men had entered the main barn, then slipped
forth, and keeping in the shadows, ran toward the
house.
</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
<a name='linki_23' id='linki_23'></a>
<img src='images/illus-241.jpg' alt='' title='' /><br />
<p class='caption' style='text-align:center;'>
HE SAW THE DETECTIVE LED BY, HIS ARMS BOUND BEHIND HIM.
<br />
</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span></div>
<p>A beam of light streamed from one of the rear
windows. Jack made for it, and cautiously approaching,
peered within. The woman he had seen at the
door was at a table, washing dishes, her back toward
him. And just beyond, facing him, and bound hand
and foot in a big arm-chair, was the detective.
</p>
<p>For some minutes Jack tried in vain to attract the
officer&#8217;s attention. Then the woman obligingly
stepped into the pantry with some dishes, and quickly
Jack gave a single tap on the window-pane. Boyle
looked up instantly, started, smiled, then nodded his
head in the direction of the railroad. Jack held up
the parcel containing the telegraph instruments, the
detective nodded again, and in a moment Jack was
off.
</p>
<p>It was an exhausting run over the rough, little-used
road, now darkened by the overhanging trees; but at
length Jack recognized the point at which he had been
carried from the woods, and turning in, soon found
himself at the railroad.
</p>
<p>Hurrying to the nearest telegraph pole, he swarmed
up to the cross-tree, and quickly filed through the wire
on one side of the glass insulator. The broken wire
fell jangling to the rails. Connecting an end of the
wire he had brought with him to the wire on the other
side of the pin, Jack slid to the ground, made the connections
with the instrument, and the relay clicked
closed.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span></p>
<p>At once someone on the wire sent, &#8220;Who had it
open? What did you say?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Alex!&#8221; exclaimed Jack, at once recognizing the
sending; and was about to break in when the instrument
clicked, &#8220;17 just coming&mdash;CX.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Claxton, and 17! Just what we want!&#8221; Quickly
interrupting, Jack sent, &#8220;CX&mdash;Hold 17! Hold her!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then, &#8220;To X&mdash;This is Jack, Al. I&#8217;m in the woods
about four miles from Claxton. We found the freight
thieves, but they have Boyle prisoner. Ask the chief
to have 17 take on a posse at CX and rush them here.
I&#8217;ll wait here, and lead them back. If they are quick
they&#8217;ll capture the whole gang.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;OK! OK! Good for you,&#8221; shot back Alex. The
wire was silent a moment, then Jack heard the order
go on to Claxton as desired.
</p>
<p>Twenty-five minutes later, waiting in the darkness
on the track, Jack saw the headlight of the fast-coming
freight. The engineer, on the lookout, discovered him,
pulled up, and a moment after Jack was off through
the woods followed by two officers and several of the
train crew.
</p>
<p>When they reached the farm, lights were still moving
about in the barn. Stealthily the party made for
it, and surrounded it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How would you like to lead the way in, Jack?&#8221;
whispered the sheriff as they paused before the door.
&#8220;That would be only fair, after the trick Watts played
on you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Jack caught at the idea delightedly, and all being
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span>
ready, boldly threw open the barn door and entered
with drawn revolver, followed by the sheriff.
</p>
<p>The four occupants were so completely taken by
surprise that for a moment they stood immovable
about a box of dry-goods they had been repacking.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you do, Mr. Watts,&#8221; said Jack, smiling.
&#8220;This is my friend the sheriff, and the barn is surrounded.
I think you would be foolish not to give
up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, hands up!&#8221; crisply ordered the sheriff. And
slowly the four pairs of hands went into the air, and
the entire balance of the long-successful gang of
freight thieves were prisoners.
</p>
<p>It was Jack himself who rushed off to the house
and freed Detective Boyle. A half hour later, with
one of the robbers&#8217; own wagons filled with a great
quantity of recovered stolen goods, the sheriff escorted
his prisoners back to the railroad, and before daylight
they were in the jail at Eastfield.
</p>
<p>Jack received considerable attention because of his
part in the capture, and the affair still forms one of
the popular yarns among trainmen on that division of
the Middle Western.

<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
<h2>XV</h2>
<h3>THE DUDE OPERATOR</h3>
</div>

<p>Alex Ward, like most vigorous, manly boys
of his type, had a fixed dislike for anything
approaching foppishness, especially in other boys.
Consequently when on reporting at the Exeter office
one evening he was introduced to Wilson Jennings,
Alex treated him with but little more than necessary
courtesy. For the newcomer, an operator but little
older than himself, was distinctly a &#8220;dude&#8221;&mdash;from
his patent-leather shoes and polka-dotted stockings to
his red-and-yellow banded white straw hat. His carefully-pressed
suit was the very latest thing in light
checked gray, he wore a collar which threatened to
envelope his ears, and his white tie was of huge dimensions.
Also he possessed the fair pink-and-white complexion
of a girl.
</p>
<p>Alex was not alone in his derisive attitude toward
the stranger. Shortly following the appearance of the
night chief Mr. Jennings nodded everyone a good-evening,
and departed, and immediately there was a
general roar of laughter in the operating-room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where did he fall from?&#8221; &#8220;Whose complexion
powder is he advertising?&#8221; &#8220;Did you get onto his
picture socks?&#8221; were some of the remarks bandied
about.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span></p>
<p>When the chief announced that the new operator
was from the east, and was being sent to the little
foothills tank-station of Bonepile, there was a fresh
outburst of hilarity.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, that cowboy outfit near there will string
him up to the tank spout,&#8221; declared the operator on
whose wire Bonepile was located. &#8220;It&#8217;s the toughest
proposition on the wire.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;On the quiet, that is just why Jordan is sending
him,&#8221; the night chief said. &#8220;Not to have him strung
up, that is, but to put him in the way of &#8216;finding himself,&#8217;
so to speak.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll certainly &#8216;find himself&#8217; there, then&mdash;if
there&#8217;s anything left to find when the ranch crew get
through,&#8221; laughed the operator. &#8220;I&#8217;d give five real
dollars to see that show, and walk back.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;At that, you <i>might</i> have to walk back, if you
wagered your money on the outcome,&#8221; responded the
chief more gravely, turning to his desk. &#8220;Clothes
don&#8217;t make a man&mdash;neither do they un-make one.
The &#8216;Dude&#8217; may surprise us yet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Whether the outcome of his appointment to the little
watering station was to be a surprise or no, there was
no doubt of Wilson Jennings&#8217; surprise when the following
morning he alighted from the train at Bonepile,
and as the train sped on, awoke to the realization
that he was entirely alone. Blankly he gazed at the
little red-brown &#8220;drygoods-box&#8221; depot, the water-tank,
the hills to the west, and to north, south and east
the limitless stretching prairie. He had never imagined
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
anything like this when he had decided on giving
up a good position in the east to taste &#8220;some adventure&#8221;
in the great west.
</p>
<p>However, here he was; and picking up his two suitcases,
the boy made his way in to the tiny operating-room,
and on into the bunk-kitchen-living-room
behind. For here, &#8220;a hundred miles from anywhere,&#8221;
the operator&#8217;s board and lodging was provided by the
railroad.
</p>
<p>Early that evening Wilson was sitting somewhat
disconsolately at the telegraph-room window when he
was startled by a loud whoop. There was a second,
then a rush of hoofs, and a party of cowboys came into
view.
</p>
<p>It was the &#8220;welcoming committee&#8221; of the Bar-O
ranch, the &#8220;outfit&#8221; referred to by the operator at
Exeter.
</p>
<p>With a final whoop the cowmen thundered up to the
station platform, and dismounted. Muskoka Jones, a
huge, heavily-moustached ranchman over six feet in
height, was first to reach the open window. Diving
within to the waist, he brought a bottle down on the
instrument table with a crash.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Pardner, welcome to our city!&#8221; he shouted.
</p>
<p>The response should have been instantaneous and
hearty. Instead there was a strange quiet.
</p>
<p>The following Bar-O&#8217;s faltered, and exchanged
glances. Surely the Western had not at last &#8220;fallen
down&#8221; on its first obligation at Bonepile! For since
the coming of the rails they had regarded the station
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span>
operator as a sort of social adjunct to the ranch&mdash;the
keeper of an open house of hospitality, their daily
paper, the final learned authority on all matters of
politics and sport. And if this latest change of operators
had brought them&mdash;
</p>
<p>Muskoka spoke again, and the worst was realized.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you gal-faced little dude!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The cowmen crowded forward, and peering over
Muskoka&#8217;s board shoulders, studied Wilson from head
to foot with speechless scorn.
</p>
<p>Muskoka settled forward on his elbows.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you a real operator?&#8221; he inquired.
</p>
<p>In a voice that sounded foolish even to himself Wilson
responded in the affirmative.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Actooal, real, male operator?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The cluster of bronzed faces guffawed loudly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But y&#8217; don&#8217;t play kiards, do you?&#8221; Muskoka
asked incredulously. &#8220;Now I bet you don&#8217;t. Or
smoke? Or chew? Or any of them wicked&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here are some cigarettes the other man left.&#8221;
Hopefully the boy extended the package&mdash;to have it
snatched from his hand, scramblingly emptied, and the
box flipped ceilingward.
</p>
<p>In falling the box brought further trouble. It
struck something on the wall which emitted a hollow
thud, and glancing up the cowmen espied Wilson&#8217;s
new, brilliantly-banded hat. In a trice Muskoka&#8217;s long
arm had secured it, with the common inspiration the
cluster of faces withdrew; the hat sailed high in the
air, there was an ear-splitting rattle of shots, and the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
shattered remnant was returned to Wilson with ceremony.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&mdash;all proper millinaried dee la Bonepile,&#8221;
said Muskoka. &#8220;An&#8217; don&#8217;t mention it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now give me that white-washed fence you have
around your ears.&#8221; The boy shrank farther back in
his chair, then suddenly turned and reached for the
telegraph key. In a moment the big cowman&#8217;s pistol
was out.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Back in your chair! Give me that white fence!&#8221;
he commanded.
</p>
<p>Trembling, Wilson removed his collar and handed
it over. The cowman stepped back and calmly proceeded
to shoot a row of holes in it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There,&#8221; he announced, returning it, &#8220;much better.
That&#8217;s Bonepile fashion. Put it on.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Meekly Wilson obeyed, and the circle of cowmen
roared at the result.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; proceeded Muskoka, &#8220;that coat of yours is
nice. Very nice. But I think it&#8217;d look better inside-out.
Try it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wilson again turned desperately toward the key,
the cowman banged on the table with his pistol, and
slowly the boy complied. And a few minutes after,
on a further command, he emerged from the doorway&mdash;in
shattered hat, perforated collar, ridiculously
turned coat, and with trousers rolled to his knees&mdash;a
spectacle that set the cowboys staggering and shouting
about the platform in convulsions of laughter.
</p>
<p>In fact the result was so pleasing that after enjoying
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
it to the full, the ranchmen decided to carry the
hazing no further, and only requesting of Wilson that
he wave his hat and give &#8220;three cheers for the citizens
of Bonepile,&#8221; they mounted their ponies, and scampered
away.
</p>
<p>Hastening in to the telegraph instruments, Wilson
began frantically calling Exeter. Before X had responded,
however, the boy paused, and sat back in his
chair, a new light coming into his eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir; I&#8217;ll wager they sent them down here
to do this,&#8221; he said aloud.
</p>
<p>Suddenly he arose, and began removing the turned
coat. &#8220;I&#8217;ll stick it out here for two weeks&mdash;if they
lynch me!&#8221; declared the &#8220;dude&#8221; grimly.
</p>
<p>It was early Wednesday evening of a week later
that the monthly gold shipment came down from the
Red Valley mines. The consignment was an unusually
large one, and in view of the youth of the new
operator the superintendent wired a request that Big
Bill Smith, the driver of the mines express, remain
at the station until the treasure was safely aboard
train.
</p>
<p>On reading the message, however, Big Bill flatly
refused. &#8220;Why, it&#8217;s the night of Dan Haggerty&#8217;s
dance,&#8221; he pointed out indignantly. &#8220;Doesn&#8217;t the
superintendent know that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The superintendent didn&#8217;t&mdash;and didn&#8217;t care,&#8221;
was the response to the wired protest. &#8220;The driver
was supposed to remain at all times. It was an old
understanding.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span></p>
<p>Understanding or not, Big Bill declined to remain,
and stormed out the door, announcing that he would
get someone down from the Bar-O ranch. Half an
hour later Muskoka Jones appeared.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good evening. I&#8217;m sorry it was necessary to
trouble you, sir,&#8221; apologized Wilson.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good evening, Willie. Don&#8217;t mention it,&#8221; was the
big cowman&#8217;s scornful response. Then, having momentarily
paused to cast a contemptuous eye over the
lad&#8217;s neat attire, he threw himself on the floor in the
farthermost corner of the room, and promptly fell fast
asleep.
</p>
<p>Some time after darkness had fallen the young telegrapher,
dozing in his chair at the instrument table,
was startled into consciousness by the sound of approaching
hoofbeats. With visions of Indians or robbers
he sprang to the window, to discover a dim, tall
figure dismounting on the platform. In alarm he
turned to call the sleeping guard, but momentarily hesitating,
looked again, the figure came into the light of
the window, and with relief he recognized Iowa Burns,
another of the Bar-O cowmen.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, kid,&#8221; said the newcomer, entering.
&#8220;Where&#8217;s Old Muskoke?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good evening. Over there, asleep, sir. I suppose
you knew he was taking Mr. Smith&#8217;s place, guarding
the gold until the train came in?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, yes. I was there when Bill come up.&#8221; He
crossed to the side of the snoring Jones, and kicked
him sharply on the sole of his boots. &#8220;M&#8217;skoke! Git
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span>
up!&#8221; he shouted. &#8220;Here&#8217;s something to keep out the
chills.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Again, and more sharply, he kicked the sleeping
man, while the boy looked on, smiling.
</p>
<p>Suddenly the smile disappeared, and the lad&#8217;s heart
leaped into his throat. He was gazing into the black,
round muzzle of a pistol, and beyond it was a face set
with a deadly purpose. Instinctively his staring eyes
flickered towards the box of bullion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yep, that&#8217;s it. But wink an eye agin, an&#8217; y&#8217; git
it!&#8221; said Burns coldly, advancing. &#8220;Now, git back
there up agin the corner of the table, an&#8217; stand, so &#8217;f
anyone comes along you&#8217;ll appear to be leanin&#8217; there,
conversin&#8217;. Go on, quick!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Dazed, cold with fear, the boy obeyed, and Iowa,
producing a sheaf of hide thongs, proceeded to bind
his arms to his side.
</p>
<p>As the renegade tightened a knot securing the boy&#8217;s
left leg to the leg of the table, Muskoka&#8217;s snoring abruptly
ceased, and the sleeper moved uneasily. In a
flash Iowa was over him, pistol in hand. But the snoring
presently resumed, and after watching him sharply
for a moment, Iowa returned to the boy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now move, remember, an&#8217; I shoot,&#8221; he repeated
warningly. &#8220;To make sure, I&#8217;m going to fix up that
snoring idiot over there before I finish you. An&#8217; don&#8217;t
you as much as shuffle your hoof!&#8221; Recovering the
bundle of thongs, he strode back to the sleeper.
</p>
<p>As previously the man&#8217;s back had been turned Wilson
had shot a frantic glance about him. In their
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
sweep his eyes had fallen on the partly open drawer
in the end of the table, immediately below his left
hand, and in the drawer had noted the bowl of a pipe.
At the moment nothing had resulted, but as the renegade&#8217;s
back was again turned his eyes again dropped
to the drawer, and a sudden wild possibility occurred
to him.
</p>
<p>His heart seemed literally to stand still at the audacity,
the danger of it. But might it not be possible?
The light from the single lamp, on the wall opposite,
was poor, and his left side thus in deep shadow. And
his left hand&mdash;he tried it&mdash;yes, though tightly bound
at the wrist, the hand itself was free.
</p>
<p>His first day at the station, the visit of the men
from the ranch, Muskoka&#8217;s contemptuous greeting,
recurred to him. Here was his opportunity of vindication.
</p>
<p>With a desperate clenching of the teeth the boy decided,
and at once began cautiously straining at the
thongs about his wrist, to obtain the reach necessary.
Finally they slipped, slightly, but enough. Carefully
he leaned sideways, his fingers extended. He reached
the pipe, fumbled a moment, and secured it.
</p>
<p>Burns was on his knees beside the unconscious
guard, splicing a thong. An instant Wilson hesitated,
then springing erect, pointed the pipe-stem, and in a
voice he scarcely knew, a voice sharp as the crack of
a whip, cried:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hands up, Burns! I got you!
</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Quick! I&#8217;ll shoot!</i>&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span></p>
<p>The renegade cowman, taken completely by surprise,
leaped to his feet with a cry, without turning, his hands
instinctively half-raised.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Quick! Up! <i>Up!</i>&#8221; cried the boy. A breathlessly
critical instant the hands wavered, then slowly, reluctantly,
they ascended.
</p>
<p>For a moment the young operator stood panting,
but half believing the witness of his own eyes to the
success of the stratagem. Then at the top of his voice
he cried: &#8220;Mr. Jones! Mr. Jones! Muskoka! Wake
up! Wake up!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Iowa, muttering beneath his breath, paused anxiously
to watch results.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Muskoka! Muskoka!&#8221; shouted the lad. The
snoring continued evenly, unbrokenly.
</p>
<p>Iowa indulged in a dry laugh. &#8220;Save your wind,
kid,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I fixed a drink he took before he came
down.&#8221;
</p>
<p>At this news the boy&#8217;s heart sank.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But look here, kid.&#8221; Iowa turned carefully, hands
still in the air. &#8220;Look here, can&#8217;t we square this thing
up? You got the drop on me, O K&mdash;and with a
blame little pea-shooter,&#8221; he added, catching a glimpse,
as he thought, of the end of a small black barrel, but
nevertheless continuing his attitude of surrender.
&#8220;You got the drop&mdash;and you&#8217;re a smart kid, you
are&mdash;but can&#8217;t we fix this thing up? You take half,
say? I&#8217;d be glad to let you in. Honest! An&#8217; no
one&#8217;d ever think you was in the game. Come, what
d&#8217; y&#8217; say?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span></p>
<p>Though apparently listening, the young operator
was in reality urgently casting about in his mind for
other expedients. Obviously it would be too dangerous
to attempt to reach with the fingers of one of his
bound hands the thongs holding his left leg to the leg
of the table. He might reveal the pipe, or drop it.
And neither could he reach the telegraph key, to get in
touch with someone on the wire. And in any case, how
could that help him? For the next train was not due
for two hours, and it did not seem possible he could
carry on his bluff that length of time.
</p>
<p>But think as he would, the wire seemed the only
hope. Could he not reach the key in some way?
</p>
<p>The solution came as Iowa ventured a short step
nearer, and repeated his suggestion. At first sight
it seemed as ridiculously impossible as the bluff with
the pipe, but quickly the boy weighed the chances, and
determined to take the risk.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Mr. Iowa,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you are to do just
exactly what I tell you, step by step, so much and no
more. If you make any other move, if I only think
you are going to, I shall shoot. My finger is pressing
the trigger constantly. And I guess you can see that
at this range, though my hold on the gun is a bit
cramped, I could not miss you if I wanted to.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen, now. You will come forward until you
can reach the chair here by sticking out your foot.
Then you will push it back along the table to the wall,
and turn it face to me. Then you will sit down in it.
After that I&#8217;ll tell you some more.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Go ahead! And remember&mdash;my finger always
pressing the trigger!&#8221;
</p>
<p>As Burns came forward, infinitely puzzled, the boy
turned slowly, so that the &#8220;muzzle&#8221; of the pipe continued
to cover the would-be bullion thief. Gingerly
Iowa reached out with his foot and shoved the chair
back to the wall, and turning, backed into it and sat
down. With the shadow of a grin on his face, he
demanded, &#8220;Wot next?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, slowly let your left arm down at full length
on the table. There&mdash;hand is on the key, isn&#8217;t it?
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; continued Wilson, who never for an instant
allowed his eyes to wander from the man&#8217;s face, &#8220;now
feel with your fingers at the back of the key, and find
a screw-head, standing up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Which one? There are two or three,&#8221; said Iowa
craftily.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, there are not. There&#8217;s just one. And I give
you &#8216;three&#8217; to find it,&#8221; said the young operator
sharply. &#8220;One, two&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, go on! I got it!&#8221; exclaimed Iowa angrily.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Below the screw-head is a binding-nut. Loosen
it, and turn it leftwise. Found it? Now take hold of
the screw-head again, and turn it to the left. It turns
free, doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Turn it about four times completely around. Now
the binding nut again, down, the other way, till it&#8217;s
tight. Got it?
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, hold your finger tips over the black button
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span>
at the inner end of the key, and hit down on it
smartly.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was a click.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it. It has plenty of play, hasn&#8217;t it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Works up and down about an inch, if that&#8217;s wot
you mean,&#8221; growled Iowa, still puzzled. &#8220;But
wot&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to give you a lesson in telegraphy and
you are going to&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Iowa saw, and exploded. &#8220;Well, of all the&mdash;Say,
wot do you think&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right!&#8221; Sharply, bravely, though inwardly
steeling himself for catastrophe, the lad counted,
&#8220;One!&mdash;Two!&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Again he won. &#8220;Oh, go on!&#8221; sputtered Iowa,
through gritting teeth. And the boy resumed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hit the key a sharp rap! Pretty good. Now, two
raps, one right after the other. Good.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, those are what we call &#8216;dots.&#8217; Remember.
Now, press the key down, hold it for just a moment,
and let it come up again. Very good. You would
learn telegraphy quickly, Mr. Burns. That is what we
call a &#8216;dash.&#8217;&#8221; With the situation apparently so well
in hand, Wilson was beginning almost to enjoy it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now I&#8217;ll have you do what I&#8217;ve been aiming at.
And remember always&mdash;my finger is constantly pressing
the trigger!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now then, feel just this side of the key button,
below. The little button of a lever? Got it? Press it
from you.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span></p>
<p>There was a single sharp upward click of relay and
sounder. The key was &#8220;open,&#8221; ready for operation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now listen. I want you to make the letter X&mdash;a
dot, a dash, then two more dots right together. And
keep repeating till I stop you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Still under the spell of the fancied revolver and the
boy&#8217;s unfaltering gaze, the renegade cowman obeyed,
and the telegraph instruments clicked out a painfully
deliberate, but fairly readable &#8220;X.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was an idle half-hour, and when the despatcher
at Exeter heard his call he glanced up from a magazine,
listened a moment, and impatiently remarking, &#8220;Some
idiot student!&#8221; returned to his reading.
</p>
<p>But steadily, insistently, the repetition of X&#8217;s continued,
and at length he reached forward, struck open
the key, and demanded, &#8220;Who? Sign!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Clumsily came the answer, &#8220;B.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Bonepile! Now what&#8217;s happening down there?
It doesn&#8217;t sound like the new operator, either.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The wire again clicked open, and slowly, in the
same heavy hand, the mystified and then amazed despatcher
read:
</p>
<p>&#8220;H-E-L-P&mdash;H-E-L-D U-P&mdash;A-F-T-E-R
G-O-L-D&mdash;T-I-E-D T-O T-A-B-L-E&mdash;G-O-T
D-R-O-P O-N H-I-M&mdash;M-A-K-I-N-G H-I-M
S-E-N-D&mdash;B.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The despatcher grasped his key. &#8220;Good boy! Good
boy!&#8221; he hurled back. &#8220;Keep it up for twenty-five
minutes and we&#8217;ll get help to you. There&#8217;s an extra
engine at H, waiting for 92. I&#8217;ll start her right
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span>
down.&#8221; And therewith he whirled off into an urgent
succession of &#8220;H&#8217;s.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But through young Jennings&#8217; strange feat in telegraphy
help was nearer even than the unexpected
succor from Hillside. Despite the sleeping draught
Burns had administered to Muskoka Jones, the unaccustomed
clicking of the telegraph instruments had
begun to arouse the big cowman. When finally, in
climax, came the lightning whirr of the despatcher&#8217;s
excited response, he gasped into consciousness, blinked,
and suddenly found himself sitting upright, staring
open-mouthed at the spectacle before him.
</p>
<p>The next moment, with a shout, he was on his feet
in the middle of the floor, and the nerve-strung boy
had fainted.
</p>
<p>As the lad sank forward his &#8220;pistol&#8221; fell from his
hand and rolled into the light.
</p>
<p>From Burns came an inarticulate cry, his jaw
dropped, his eyes started in his head. Muskoka
halted in his stride, wet his lips and muttered incredulous
words of admiration and amazement. Then in
a moment he had cut Wilson free, and stretched him
on the floor.
</p>
<p>It was Iowa broke the silence. Rising, with compressed
lips he held toward Muskoka the butt of his
pistol. &#8220;Here, shoot me&mdash;with my own gun!&#8221; he
said hoarsely. &#8220;I deserve it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Muskoka considered. &#8220;No,&#8221; he decided at length.
&#8220;Leave your gun as a present for the kid, and,&#8221; turning
and indicating the door, &#8220;git!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span></p>
<p>Thus was it the young &#8220;dude&#8221; operator proved
himself, and came into possession of a handsome pearl-handled
Colt&#8217;s revolver&mdash;and, early the following
morning, from a &#8220;committee&#8221; of the Bar-O cowmen,
headed by Muskoka Jones, a fine high-crowned, silver-spangled
Mexican sombrero, to take the place of the
hat they had destroyed, and &#8220;as a mark of esteem
for the pluckiest little operator ever sent to Bonepile.&#8221;
</p>
<p>More important still, however, the incident won
Wilson immediate esteem at division headquarters,
where one of the first of the operators to congratulate
him was Alex Ward.

<h2>XVI</h2>
<h3>A DRAMATIC FLAGGING</h3>
</div>

<p>Since shortly following Jack Orr&#8217;s appointment to
Midway Junction Alex had been &#8220;agitating,&#8221; as
he called it, for his friend&#8217;s transfer to the telegraph
force at the division terminal. At length, early in
the fall, Alex&#8217;s efforts bore fruit, and Jack was offered,
and accepted, the &#8220;night trick&#8221; at one of the big yard
towers at Exeter.
</p>
<p>Of course the two chums were now always together.
And the day of the big flood that October was no exception
to the rule. All afternoon the two boys had
wandered up and down the swollen river, watching
the brown whirling waters, almost bank high, and the
trees, fences, even occasional farm buildings, which
swept by from above. When six o&#8217;clock came they
reluctantly left it for supper, and the night&#8217;s duties.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what do you think of the river, Ward?&#8221;
inquired the chief night despatcher as Alex entered
the despatching-room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It looks rather bad, sir, doesn&#8217;t it. Do you think
the bridge is quite safe?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite. It has been through several worse floods
than this. It&#8217;s as strong as the hills,&#8221; the despatcher
affirmed.
</p>
<p>Despite the chief&#8217;s confidence, however, when about
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span>
5 o&#8217;clock in the morning there came reports of a second
cloud-burst up the river, he requested Alex to call up
Jack, at the yard tower which overlooked the bridge,
and ask him to keep them posted.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell him the crest of this new flood will likely
reach us in half an hour,&#8221; he added; &#8220;and that by that
time, as it is turning colder, there&#8217;ll probably be a
heavy fog on the river.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Twenty-five minutes later Jack suddenly called, and
announced, &#8220;The new flood&#8217;s coming! There is a
heavy mist, and I can&#8217;t see, but I can hear it. Can
you see it from up there?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Alex and the chief despatcher moved to one of the
western windows, raised it, and in the first gray light
of dawn gazed out across the valley below. Instead
of the dark waters of the river, and the yellow embankment
of the railroad following it, winding away north
was a broad blanket of fog, stretching from shore to
shore. But distinctly to their ears came a rumble as
of thunder.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It must be a veritable Niagara,&#8221; remarked the
chief with some uneasiness. &#8220;I never heard a bore
come down like that before.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here she comes,&#8221; clicked Jack from the tower.
They stepped back to his instruments.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Say!&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was a pause, while the chief and Alex exchanged
glances of apprehension, then came quickly,
&#8220;Something has struck one of the western spans of
the bridge and carried it clean away&mdash;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No&mdash;No, it&#8217;s there yet! But it&#8217;s all smashed
to pieces! Only the upper-structure seems to be holding!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sharply the despatcher turned to an operator at one
of the other wires. &#8220;McLaren, Forty-six hasn&#8217;t
passed Norfolk?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir. Five minutes ago.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A cry broke from the chief, and he ran back to the
window. Alex followed, and found him as pale as
death.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter, Mr. Allen?&#8221; he exclaimed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Matter! Why, Norfolk is the last stop between
that train and the bridge! She&#8217;ll be down here in
twenty minutes! And even if we can get someone
across the bridge immediately, how can they flag her
in that wall of mist?&#8221; Hopelessly he pointed where
on the farther shore the tracks were completely hidden
in the blanket of white vapor. &#8220;And there&#8217;s no time
to send down torpedoes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>At the thought of the train rushing upon the broken
span, and plunging from sight in the whirling flood
below, Alex felt the blood draw back from his own
face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But we will try something! We must try something!&#8221;
he cried.
</p>
<p>At that moment the office door opened and Division
Superintendent Cameron appeared. &#8220;Good morning,
boys,&#8221; he said genially. &#8220;I&#8217;m quite an early bird this
morning, eh? Came down to meet the wife and children.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span>
They&#8217;re getting in from their vacation by
Forty-six.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Allen, what is the matter?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The chief swayed back against the window-ledge.
&#8220;One of the bridge spans&mdash;has just gone,&#8221; he
responded thickly, &#8220;and Forty-six&mdash;passed Norfolk!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The superintendent stared blankly a moment, started
forward, then staggered back into a chair. But in
another instant he was on his feet, pallid, but cool.
&#8220;Well, what are you doing to stop her?&#8221; he demanded
sharply.
</p>
<p>The chief pulled himself together. &#8220;It only happened
this moment, sir. The man at the yard tower
just reported. One of the western spans was struck
by something. Only the upper-structure is hanging,&#8221;
he says.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you send someone over on foot, with a flag,
or torpedoes?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There are no torpedoes at the bridge house, and
there&#8217;s not time to send them down. As to flagging&mdash;look
at the mist over the whole valley bottom,&#8221;
said the despatcher pointing. &#8220;Except directly opposite,
where the wind between the hills breaks it up at
times, the engineer couldn&#8217;t see three feet ahead of
him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The superintendent gripped his hands convulsively.
Suddenly he turned to Alex. &#8220;Ward, can&#8217;t you suggest
something?&#8221; he appealed. &#8220;You have always
shown resource in emergencies.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I have been trying to think of something, sir.
But, as the chief says, even if we could get a man
across the bridge, what could he do? I was down by
the river yesterday morning, and the haze was like
a blind wall.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t a fire be built on the tracks?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not quickly enough, sir. Everything is soaking
wet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The superintendent strode up and down helplessly.
&#8220;And of course it had to happen after the Riverside
Park station had closed for the season,&#8221; he said bitterly.
&#8220;If we had had an operator there we&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>The interruption was a cry from Alex. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
something! Oil!&#8221;
</p>
<p>He dashed for the tower wire.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What? What&#8217;s that?&#8221; cried the superintendent,
running after.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oil on a pile of ties, or anything, sir&mdash;providing
Orr can get over the bridge,&#8221; Alex explained hurriedly
as he whirled off the letters of Jack&#8217;s call. The official
dropped into the chair beside him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I, I, TR,&#8221; answered Jack.
</p>
<p>&#8220;OR, have you any oil in the tower?&#8221; shot Alex.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, but there&#8217;s some in the lamp-shed just below.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Look here, could you possibly get across the
bridge?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I might manage it. There is a rail bicycle in the
lamp-house. If the rails are hanging together perhaps
I could shoot over with that. Why?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span></p>
<p>&#8220;46 is due in twenty minutes, and apparently we
have no way of stopping her except through you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, certainly I&#8217;ll risk it,&#8221; buzzed the sounder.
&#8220;I suppose the oil is to make a quick blaze, to flag
her?&#8221; Jack added, catching Alex&#8217;s idea.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it. Make it just this side of the Riverside
Park station.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;OK! Here goes!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good luck,&#8221; sent Alex, with a sudden catch in his
throat, as he realized the danger his chum was so
cheerfully running. &#8220;God help him!&#8221; added the
superintendent fervently.
</p>
<p>Jack, in the distant tower, took little time to think
of the danger himself. Catching up a lantern and
lighting it, he was quickly out and down the tower
steps, and running for the nearby shed. Fortunately
it was unlocked. Darting in, he found a large can of
oil. Carrying it out to the main-line track, he returned,
and hurriedly dragged forth the yard lamp-man&#8217;s
rail bicycle&mdash;a three-wheeled affair, with the
seat and gear of an ordinary bicycle.
</p>
<p>Swinging the little car onto the rails, he placed the
oil can on the platform between the arms, swung the
lantern over the handlebars, mounted, and was off,
pedalling with all his might.
</p>
<p>As he speedily neared the down-grade of the bridge
approach, and the roar of the flood met him in full
force, Jack for the first time began to realize the
danger of his mission. But with grimly set lips, he
refused to think of it, and pedalled ahead determinedly.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span></p>
<p>He topped the grade, and below him was a solid
roof of mist, only the bridge towers showing.
</p>
<p>Apprehensively, but without hesitation, he sped
downward. The first dampness of the vapor struck
him. The next moment he was lost in a blinding wall
of white. He could not see the rails.
</p>
<p>On he pedalled with bowed head. Suddenly came
a roar beneath him. He was over the water.
</p>
<p>Jack&#8217;s occasional views from the tower had shown
him where the bridge was shattered; and for some
distance he continued ahead at a good speed. Then
judging he was nearing the wrecked portion, he
slowed down and went on very slowly, peering before
him with straining eyes, and listening sharply for a
note in the tumult of water below which might tell
of the broken timbers and twisted iron.
</p>
<p>It came, a roar of swirling, choking and gurgling.
Simultaneously there was a trembling of the rails beneath
him.
</p>
<p>He was on the shattered span.
</p>
<p>At a crawl Jack proceeded. The vibration became
more violent. On one side the track began to dip.
Momentarily Jack hesitated, and paused. At once
came a picture of the train rushing toward him, and
conquering his fear, he went on.
</p>
<p>Suddenly the track swayed violently, then dipped
sharply sideways. With a cry Jack sprang off backwards,
and threw himself flat on his face on the sleepers.
Trembling, deafened by the roar of the cataract
just beneath him, he lay afraid to move, believing
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span>
the swaying structure would give way every instant.
But finally the rails steadied, and partly righted; and
regaining his courage, Jack rose to his knees, and began
working his way forward from tie to tie, pushing
the bicycle ahead of him.
</p>
<p>Presently the rails became steadier. Cautiously he
climbed back into the saddle, and slowly at first, then
with quickly increasing speed and rising hope, pushed
on. The vibration decreased, the track again became
even and firm. Suddenly at last the thunder of the
river passed from below him, and he was safely across.
</p>
<p>A few yards from the bridge, and still in the mist,
Jack peered down to see that the oil can was safe.
He caught his breath. Reaching out, he felt about
the little platform with his foot.
</p>
<p>Yes; it was gone! The tipping of the car had sent
it into the river.
</p>
<p>As the significance of its loss burst upon him, and
he thought of the peril he had come through to no
purpose, Jack sat upright in the saddle, and the tears
welled to his eyes.
</p>
<p>Promptly, however, came remembrance of the
Riverside Park station, a mile ahead of him. Perhaps
there was oil there!
</p>
<p>Clenching his teeth, and bending low over the handlebars,
Jack shot on, determined to fight it out to
the finish.
</p>
<p>Meantime, at the main office the entire staff, including
the superintendent, the chief despatcher and Alex,
were crowded in the western windows, watching, waiting
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span>
and listening. Shortly after Alex had announced
Jack&#8217;s departure a suppressed shout had greeted the
tiny light of his lantern on the bridge approach, and
a subdued cheer of good luck had followed him as
he had disappeared into the wall of mist.
</p>
<p>Then had succeeded a painful silence, while all eyes
were fixed anxiously on the spot opposite where a light
west wind, blowing down through a cut in the hills,
occasionally lifted the blanket of fog and dimly disclosed
the river bank and track.
</p>
<p>Minute after minute passed, however, and Jack did
not reappear. The silence became ominous.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Surely he should be over by this time, and we
should have had a glimpse of his light,&#8221; said the chief.
&#8220;Unless&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>An electrifying cry of &#8220;There he is!&#8221; interrupted
him, and all momentarily saw a tiny, twinkling light,
and a small dark figure shooting along the distant
track.
</p>
<p>A moment after the buzz of excited hope as suddenly
died. From the north came a long, low-pitched
&#8220;Too&mdash;oo, too&mdash;oo, oo, oo!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The train!
</p>
<p>&#8220;How far up, Allen?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Three miles.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The superintendent groaned. &#8220;He&#8217;ll never do it!
He&#8217;ll never do it! She&#8217;ll be at the bridge in five
minutes!&#8221;
</p>

FORWARD FROM TIE TO TIE.

</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span></div>
<p>&#8220;No; Broad is careful,&#8221; declared the chief, referring
to the engineer of the coming train. &#8220;He won&#8217;t
keep up that speed when he strikes the worst of the
fog. There are eight or ten minutes yet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Again came the long, mellow notes of the big engine,
whistling a crossing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s that?&#8221; said Alex suddenly, half turning
from the window. The next moment with a cry of
&#8220;He&#8217;s at the station! Orr&#8217;s at the Park station!&#8221;
he darted to the calling instruments, and shot back an
answer. The rest rushed after, and crowded about
him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m at the Park station,&#8221; whirled the sounder.
&#8220;I broke in. I lost the oil can on the bridge. There
is no oil here. What shall I do?&#8221;
</p>
<p>As the chief read off the excited words to the superintendent,
the official sank limply and hopelessly into
a chair.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But might there not be some there, somewhere?
Who would know, Mr. Allen?&#8221;
</p>
<p>At Alex&#8217;s words the chief spun about. &#8220;McLaren,
call Flanagan on the &#8217;phone!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Quick!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The operator sprang to the telephone, and in intense
silence the party waited.
</p>
<p>He got the number.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello! Is Flanagan there?
</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, is there any oil across the river at the Park
station?
</p>
<p>&#8220;For Heavens sake, don&#8217;t ask questions! Is
there?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; he says there&#8217;s a half barrel in the shed
behind,&#8221; reported the operator.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span></p>
<p>Alex&#8217;s hand shot back to the key.
</p>
<p>At the first dot he paused.
</p>
<p>Through the open window came a whistle, strong
and clear.
</p>
<p>The chief threw up his hands. Alex himself sank
back in his chair, helplessly.
</p>
<p>Suddenly he again started forward.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have it!&#8221;
</p>
<p>With the sharp words he again grasped the key,
and while those about him listened with bated breath
he sent like a flash, &#8220;Jack, there&#8217;s a barrel of oil in
the shed at the rear. Knock the head in, spill it, and
set a match to it.
</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Burn the station!&#8221;</i>
</p>
<p>The chief and the operators gasped, then with one
accord set up a shout and darted back for the windows.
The superintendent, told of the message,
rushed after.
</p>
<p>In absolute silence all fixed their eyes on the spot
a mile up the river where lay the little summer depot.
</p>
<p>Once more came the long-drawn &#8220;Too&mdash;oo, too&mdash;oo,
oo, oo!&#8221; for a crossing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The next&#8217;ll tell,&#8221; said the chief tensely&mdash;&#8220;for
the crossing this side of the station, or&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>It came. It was the crossing.
</p>
<p>But the next instant from the mist shot up a lurid
flare. From the windows rose a cry. Higher leaped
the flames. And suddenly across the quiet morning
air came a long series of quick sharp toots. Again
they came&mdash;then the short, sharp note for brakes.
</p>
<div class='figcenter'>

<p class='caption' style='text-align:center;'>
WITH THE SHARP WORDS HE AGAIN GRASPED THE KEY.
<br />
</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span></div>
<p>And the boys and the flames had won!
</p>
<p>The superintendent turned and held out his hand.
&#8220;Ward, thank you,&#8221; he said huskily. &#8220;Thank you.
You are a genuine railroader.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And&mdash;about the station?&#8221; queried Alex, a sudden
apprehension in his face and voice. For the moment
the crisis was past he had realized with dismay
that he had issued the unprecedented order for the
burning of the station entirely on his own responsibility.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The station?&#8221; The superintendent laughed.
&#8220;My boy, that was the best part of it. That was the
generalship of it. There was no time to ask, only act.
The fraction of a second might have lost the train.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; that is just why I say you are a genuine
railroader&mdash;the burning of the station was a piece of
the finest kind of railroading!
</p>
<p>&#8220;And this reminds me,&#8221; added the superintendent
some minutes later, leading Alex aside and speaking
in a lower voice. &#8220;We expect to start construction
on the Yellow Creek branch in six weeks, and will be
wanting an &#8216;advance guard&#8217; of three or four heady,
resourceful operators with the construction train, or
on ahead. Would you like to go? and your friend
Orr? There&#8217;ll be plenty of excitement before we are
through.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like nothing better, sir, or Orr either, I
know,&#8221; declared Alex with immediate interest. &#8220;But
where will the excitement come in, sir?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have heard the talk of the K. &amp; Z. also running
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span>
a line to the new gold field from Red Deer? And
that they were held up by right-of-way trouble?
Well, we have just learned that that was all a bluff;
that they have been quietly making preparations, and
are about to start construction almost immediately.
And you see what that means?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A race for the Yellow pass?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A race&mdash;and more than that. Did you ever read
of the great war between the Santa Fe and the Rio
Grande for the Grand Canyon of Colorado? Regularly
organized bands of fighting men on either side,
and pitched battles? Well, I don&#8217;t anticipate matters
coming to that point between us and the K. &amp; Z., but
I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if it came near it before we
are through. The lines traverse wild country, and the
K. &amp; Z. people have men in their construction department
who would pull up track or cut wires as soon as
light a pipe. In the latter case they would cut at
critical times. There is where an operator with a head
for difficulties might prove invaluable.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I would be more than glad to tackle it, sir,&#8221; agreed
Alex enthusiastically.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well then. You may consider yourself, and
your friend Orr, appointed. And if you know of anyone
else of the same brand, you might suggest him,&#8221;
the superintendent concluded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think I do, sir&mdash;at the moment,&#8221; Alex
responded.
</p>
<p>The week succeeding brought Alex a suggestion.

<h2>XVII</h2>
<h3>WILSON AGAIN DISTINGUISHES HIMSELF</h3>
</div>

<p>It was decidedly warm the following Monday noon
at Bonepile, and Wilson Jennings, his coat off,
but wearing the fancy Mexican sombrero that the
Bar-O cowmen had given him, sat in the open window
to catch the breeze that blew through from the rear.
From the window Wilson could not see the wagon-trail
toward the hills to the west. Thus was it that the
low thud of hoofs first told him of someone&#8217;s hurried
approach.
</p>
<p>Starting to his feet, he stepped to the end of the
platform. At sight of a horseman coming toward him
at full speed, and leading a second horse, saddled, but
riderless, Wilson gazed in surprise. Wonder increased
when as the rider drew nearer he recognized Muskoka
Jones, the big Bar-O cowman.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it, Muskoka?&#8221; he shouted as the ponies
approached.
</p>
<p>The cow-puncher pulled up all-standing within a
foot of the platform.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s been an explosion at the Pine Lode, kid,
and ten men are bottled up somewhere in the lower
level. Two men got in through a small hole&mdash;the
mouth of the mine is blocked&mdash;and one of them is
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span>
tapping on the iron pump-pipe. Bartlett, the mine
boss, thinks it may be telegraph ticking&mdash;that maybe
Young knows something about that. Will you come
up and listen?
</p>
<p>&#8220;You see, if they knew what was what inside,
they&#8217;d know what they could do. They are afraid
to blast the big rock that&#8217;s blocking the mouth for
fear of bringing loosened stuff down on the men who
have been caught.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wilson was running for the station door. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
explain to the despatcher,&#8221; he shouted over his shoulder.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I, I, X,&#8221; responded the despatcher.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There has been an explosion at the Pine Lode
mine,&#8221; sent Wilson rapidly, &#8220;and a man has been sent
to take me there to try and read some tapping from
the men inside. Can you give 144 and the Mail clearance
from Q and let me go up?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Some tapping? What&mdash;Oh, I understand. OK!
Go ahead,&#8221; ticked the despatcher. &#8220;Get back as soon
as possible.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, Muskoke,&#8221; cried Wilson, hastening
forth, struggling into his coat as he ran.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Get round thar,&#8221; shouted the cowboy, swinging
the spare pony to the platform. Wilson went into the
saddle with a neat bound.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, you&#8217;ve seen a hoss before, kid,&#8221; observed
Muskoka with surprise as he threw over the reins.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure I have. Used to spend my summer vacations
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span>
on a farm. Can ride a bit standing up,&#8221; said
Wilson, with pride.
</p>
<p>They swung their animals about together, and were
off on the jump. As the two ponies stretched out to
their full stride the cowboy eyed Wilson&#8217;s easy seat
with approval. &#8220;Well, kid,&#8221; he observed after a moment&#8217;s
silence, &#8220;next time I come across a dude I&#8217;ll
git him to do his tricks before I brand him. I don&#8217;t
see but what you sit about as good as I do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wilson&#8217;s pleased smile gave place to gravity as he
returned to the subject of the explosion. &#8220;When did
it happen?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Early this morning. Just after the men went in.
They&#8217;re not sure, but think it was powder stored
at the foot of the shaft down to the lower level. The
main lead of the Pine Lode, you know, runs straight
into the mountain, not down; and the shaft to the
lower level is a ways in. We heard the noise at the
Bar-O.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing much to see, or do, though,&#8221; the
cowman added as they raced along neck and neck.
&#8220;A big rock just over the entrance came down, and
when they got the dirt away they found it had bottled
the thing up like a cork. It&#8217;s that they are afraid to
blast until they know how the men are fixed inside.
Hoover and Young got in through a small hole at the
top, Hoover about half an hour before Young. He
started tapping on the pipe too, then stopped. They
don&#8217;t know what happened to him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Twenty minutes&#8217; hard riding brought them to the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span>
foothills. Still at the gallop the ponies were urged
up a winding rocky trail, and finally a tall black chimney
and a group of rough buildings came into view.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There it is,&#8221; said the cowboy, indicating a ledge
just above.
</p>
<p>As they went forward, still at full speed, Wilson
gazed toward the mine entrance with some astonishment.
Mine disasters he had always thought of as
scenes of great excitement&mdash;people running to and
fro, wringing their hands, excited crowds held back
by ropes, and men calling and shouting. Here, about
a spot but little distinguished from the rest of the
rocky, sparsely-treed mountain side, was gathered a
group of perhaps fifty men, some sitting on beams and
rocks, others moving quietly about, all smoking.
</p>
<p>On their being discovered, however, there was a
stir, and as Muskoka and the boy dismounted at the
foot of a rough path and ascended there was a general
movement of the miners and cowmen to meet them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I got him,&#8221; Muskoka announced briefly to a
grizzle-haired man who met them at the top. &#8220;This
is Bartlett, the mine boss,&#8221; he said to Wilson by way
of introduction. The boss nodded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The tapping&#8217;s going on yet, is it, Joe?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No. It&#8217;s stopped, just like Hoover&#8217;s did,&#8221; was
the gloomy response. &#8220;And just when we were getting
onto it ourselves.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The speaker held up a small board pencilled with
figures and letters. &#8220;Redding there hit on the idea
that maybe Young was knocking out the numbers of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span>
letters in the alphabet, and we made this table, and
just found out we had it right when the tapping
stopped. That was twenty minutes ago, and we
haven&#8217;t had another knock since.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s see it. What did you get?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There&mdash;&#8216;20, 7, 5, 20, 21, 16&#8216;&mdash;&#8217;T G E T U P.&#8217;
Something about &#8216;can&#8217;t get up,&#8217; we figured it. But
it&#8217;s not enough to be of any use.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And there&#8217;s not another man here can wriggle
in through the hole,&#8221; went on the boss, turning toward
the great rock which sealed the mouth of the mine.
&#8220;A dozen of &#8217;em tried it, and Redding got stuck so
we had to get a rope on him. Nearly pulled his legs
off.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wilson made his way forward and examined the
strangely blocked entrance. The small hole referred
to was a triangular-shaped opening about a foot in
height and some sixteen inches in width, apparently
just at the roof of the gallery. Some minutes Wilson
stood studying it, pondering. Finally he turned about
with an air of decision and returned to Muskoka and
the mine boss.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have a plan,&#8221; he announced. &#8220;If you will go
back to the station again, Muskoke, I&#8217;ll send for another
operator, and go in the mine myself. Two
operators could talk backwards and forwards easily on
the piping. And&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But whar&#8217;s the other operator?&#8221; interrupted the
cowboy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a freight due at the station in about
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span>
twenty-five minutes. I can give you a message to
hand the engineer for the operator at Ledges, the next
station&mdash;a message asking the despatcher to send the
Ledges operator down on the Mail. Someone could
wait for him, and if there is no hitch he&#8217;d be here
inside of an hour and a half.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;ll work!&#8221; exclaimed the boss. &#8220;That&#8217;s it!
You&#8217;ll go, Muskoke?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sartenly. I&#8217;ll get a fresh hoss, and wait fer him
myself.&#8221; Wilson, finding an envelope in his pocket,
dropped to a boulder and began writing.
</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>&#8220;W. B. J., Exeter,&#8221; he scribbled. &#8220;Am at the
mine. The tapping has stopped. No one else can go
in, so I am going myself. Please send down operator
from Ledges to read my tapping if I am unable to
return.
</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Jennings.</span>&#8221;
</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>&#8220;Redding! Whar&#8217;s Red?&#8221; shouted Muskoka as
he folded the message.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here. What?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going back to the station for another operator.
I&#8217;m going to take your Johnny hoss. Mine&#8217;s
blowed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure yes,&#8221; agreed the owner, and with a &#8220;Good
luck, kid,&#8221; Muskoka was clattering down the path.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Mr. Bartlett, will you please explain the
plan of things inside; just how the tunnel runs?&#8221;
requested Wilson.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have a seat and I&#8217;ll draw it,&#8221; said the boss, setting
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span>
the example. He turned the board bearing the
fragmentary message, and Wilson dropped down beside
him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The main gallery, the old lead, runs straight in,
at about this dip down,&#8221; he said, drawing as he spoke.
&#8220;Runs back 550 feet, and ends. That was where the
old lead petered out.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here, about 200 feet from the entrance, is a vertical
shaft, 90 feet, that we put down to pick up the old
Pine-Knot lead. It&#8217;s from the foot of that the new
gallery, the lower level, starts. It slopes off just under
the old lead&mdash;so&mdash;330 feet, there&#8217;s a fault, and it
cants up 12 feet&mdash;so&mdash;then on down again at a bit
sharper dip, nearly 600 feet; then another fault and
a drop, and about 50 feet more.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s down there at the end we think most of the
men have been caught, but some may have been near
the shaft. The pumping-pipe where Hoover and
Young must have been tapping is here, half way between
the first and second faults, where it comes down
through a boring from the old gallery. It must have
been at that point, because we had disconnected two
leaking sections just below there only this morning.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you get down the shaft to the lower
level?&#8221; Wilson asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;There was a ladder, but it was smashed by the
explosion. Hoover, the first man in, came out for
a rope, so I suppose that&#8217;s there now. Young must
have gone down by it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hoover also reported that the roof of the old gallery
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span>
was in bad shape just over the shaft. That&#8217;s the
particular reason we are afraid to blast the rock here
until we know whether any of the men were caught
at the bottom of the pit.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wilson arose and began removing his collar.
&#8220;How about water, Mr. Bartlett, since the pump is
not working?&#8221; he inquired.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Unless the explosion tapped new water, there&#8217;ll
be no danger for twenty-four hours at least. But if
the drain channel of the lower gallery has been filled
the floor will be very slippery,&#8221; the mine boss added.
&#8220;It&#8217;s slate, and we left it smooth, as a runway for
the ore boxes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>As the young operator removed his spotless collar&mdash;one
similar to that which had so aroused the cowmen&#8217;s
derision on his first day at Bonepile&mdash;without
a smile one of the very men who had formed the
&#8220;welcoming committee&#8221; that day rubbed his hands
on his shirt, took it carefully, and placed it on a clean
plank.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll want a lamp. Somebody give the boy a
cap and lamp,&#8221; the boss directed. A dozen of the
miners whipped off caps with attached lamps, and
trying several, Wilson found one to fit. Then, buttoning
his coat and turning up the collar, he made his
way to the rock-sealed entrance, and climbed up to
the narrow opening.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tap as soon as I reach the pipe,&#8221; he said. &#8220;So
long!&#8221; and without more ado crawled head first within
and disappeared.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span></p>
<p>The lamp on his cap lighting up the narrow trough-like
tunnel, Wilson easily wormed his way forward
ten or twelve feet. Then the passage contracted and
became broken and twisted. However, given confidence
by the knowledge that others had passed
through, Wilson squeezed on, there presently came a
widening of the hole, then a black opening, and with
a final effort he found himself projecting into the
black depths of the empty gallery.
</p>
<p>Below him the debris sloped to the floor. Pulling
himself free, he slid and scrambled down, and quickly
was on his feet, breathing with relief. Only pausing
to brush some of the dust from his clothes, Wilson
hastened forward.
</p>
<p>Two hundred feet distant a windlass took shape in
the obscurity. He reached it, and the black opening
of the shaft to the lower level was at his feet. Looking,
he found the rope the mine boss had spoken of.
It was secured to one of the windlass supports, and
disappeared into the depths on the opposite side of
the pit. Directly below was the shattered wreck of
the ladder.
</p>
<p>Leaning over, Wilson shouted, &#8220;Hello! Hello!&#8221;
The words crashed and echoed in the shaft and about
him, but there was no reply. Once more he shouted,
then resolutely suppressing his instinctive shrinking,
he made his way about to the rope, carefully lowered
himself, and began descending hand under hand.
</p>
<p>Wilson had not gone far when with apprehension
he found the rope becoming wet and slippery with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span>
drip from the rocks above. Despite a tightened grip
his hands began to slip. In alarm he wound his feet
about the rope. Still he slipped. To dry a hand on
his sleeve, he freed it. Instantly with a cry he found
himself shooting downward. He clutched with
hands, feet and knees, but onward he plunged. In
the light of his lamp the jagged broken timbers of
the shoring shot up by him. He would be dashed to
pieces.
</p>
<p>But desperately he fought, and at last got the rope
clamped against the corner of a heel, and the speed
was retarded. A moment after he landed with an
impact that broke his hold on the rope and sent him
in a heap on his back.
</p>
<p>Rising, Wilson thankfully discovered he had escaped
injury other than a few bruises, and gazed
about him. At first sight he appeared to be in the
bottom of a well filled with broken water-soaked timbers
and gray, dripping rock. He knew there must
be an exit, however, and set about looking for it, at
the same time listening and watching shrinkingly for
signs of anyone buried in the heap of stone and timber.
Not a sound save the monotonous drip of seeping
water was to be heard, however, and presently behind
a shield of planking he located the black mouth of a
small opening.
</p>
<p>Dropping to his knees, he crawled through, and
stood upright in a downward sloping gallery similar
to that above&mdash;the &#8220;lower level.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Once more he shouted. &#8220;Hello! Hello!&#8221; The
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span>
clashing echoes died away without response, and he
started forward.
</p>
<p>Scarcely had he taken a half dozen steps when without
warning his feet shot from under him and he went
down on his back with a crash, barely saving his head
with his hands. The smooth hard rock was as slippery
as ice from the water flowing over it. Wondering
if this icy declivity had anything to do with the failure
of Hoover and Young to return, Wilson arose and
went on more cautiously.
</p>
<p>As he proceeded the walking became more and more
treacherous. Several times he again went down,
saving himself by sinking onto his outstretched
hands.
</p>
<p>On rising from one of these falls Wilson discovered
something which sent him ahead with new concern.
A few yards farther he halted with an exclamation on
the brink of a yellow stretch of water that met the
gallery roof twenty feet beyond him.
</p>
<p>Blankly he gazed at it. Then he recalled the
&#8220;fault&#8221; the mine boss had spoken of&mdash;an abrupt
rise of the gallery twelve feet. This must be it. Its
drain had choked, and filled it with water.
</p>
<p>But both Hoover and Young had passed it! The
pipe they had tapped upon was beyond. They must
have waded boldly in, dove or ducked down, and come
up on the other side. At the thought of following
them in this Wilson drew back. Had he not better
return?
</p>
<p>Could he, though? Could he ascend a rope down
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span>
which he had been unable to prevent himself sliding?
The answer was obvious.
</p>
<p>Desperately Wilson decided to venture the water,
to reach those he now knew were on the other side,
and the pumping-pipe. In preparation he first securely
wrapped the matches he carried in notepaper taken
from an envelope, and placed them in the top of the
miner&#8217;s hat. Then removing his shoes, to give him
firmer footing, he stepped into the yellow pool and
carefully made his way forward. Six feet from the
point at which the water met the top of the gallery
the water was up to his chin, and he saw he must swim
for it, and dive. Without pause, lest he should lose
his nerve, he struck out, reached the roof, took a deep
breath, and ducked down.
</p>
<p>Three quick, hard strokes, and he arose, and with
a gasp found himself at the surface again. A few
strokes onward in the darkness, and his hands met
a rough wall, over which the water was draining as
over the brink of a dam.
</p>
<p>At the same moment a sound of dull blows reached
his ears. Spluttering and blinking, Wilson drew himself
up. A shout broke from him. Far distant and
below was a point of light.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; he cried. Immediately came a chorus of
response, as though many were excitedly shouting at
once. Unable to distinguish anything from the jangle
of echoes, Wilson cried back, &#8220;Are you all safe?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Again came the clashing, incomprehensible shout.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m coming down,&#8221; he called, though not sure
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span>
that they heard him. Producing the matches from the
crown of the hat, he found they had come through
dry, and after some difficulty lighting one against the
side of another, he re-lit the lamp. While at this,
voices continued to come up to him, evidently shouting
something. But try as he could he was unable
to make out what was said. It was all a reverberating
clamor, as though a hundred people were talking at
once.
</p>
<p>As the lamp spluttered up, after the ducking which
had extinguished it, Wilson gazed down the gallery
before him with a touch of new dismay. The water
was flowing over it in a thin, glossy coat, and it was
considerably steeper than on the outer side of the fault.
Apparently the only thing to do was to slide.
</p>
<p>Working about into a sitting position, facing down
the slope, with feet spread out, as though steering a
sleigh, Wilson allowed himself to go. The rapidity
with which he gained momentum startled him. Soon
the gray damp walls were passing upward like a glistening
mist. With difficulty he kept his feet foremost.
</p>
<p>Meantime the voices from below had continued
shouting. Onward he slid, and the sounds became
clearer. At last the words came to him. They were,
&#8220;The pipe! The pipe! Catch the pump-pipe!&#8221; Then
Wilson suddenly recollected that the pipe was but half
way down the slope.
</p>
<p>Digging with his heels he sought to slow up, gazing
first at one flitting wall, then the other. On the right
a vertical streak of black appeared. He clutched with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span>
heels and hands, and sought to steer toward it. He
swept nearer, and reached with outstretched hand.
The effort swung him sideways, his fingers just grazed
the iron, and twisting about, he shot downward head
first at greater speed than ever. A moment after there
was a chorus of shouts, a sharp cry in his ears, an
impact, a rolling and tumbling, a second crash, and
Wilson felt himself dragged to his feet.
</p>
<p>About him, in a single flickering light, was a group
of strange faces. While he gazed, dazed, rubbing a
bruised head, all talked excitedly, even angrily.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you hang on, you idiot?&#8221; demanded
a voice.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is it, anyway? It&#8217;s a stranger!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And a boy!&#8221; said another.
</p>
<p>Wilson recovered his scattered wits, and quickly explained
who he was and what he had come for. Immediately
there was a joyful shout. &#8220;We&#8217;ll be out
inside of an hour!&#8221; cried one.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But how am I going to get up to the pipe?&#8221; demanded
Wilson.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We are cutting footholds up the incline.
</p>
<p>&#8220;White, get back on the job,&#8221; directed the speaker,
who Wilson later learned was the fire-boss.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You brought him down with you,&#8221; he added, to
the boy.
</p>
<p>The man spoken to began creeping up the water-covered
slope dragging a pick, and Wilson turned to
look about him. The eleven men in the party, not including
the man on the slope, were crowded together
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span>
on the level floor of what evidently was the lower
fault of the lead. From the darkness beyond came the
sound of water trickling to a lower level.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are all here, and no one hurt?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hoover and Young, and everybody, and not one
scratched,&#8221; responded the fire-boss. &#8220;You were the
one nearest hurt.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You were a mighty plucky youngster,&#8221; he added,
&#8220;to come through that water up there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wilson interrupted a chorus of hearty assent.
&#8220;What happened to Hoover and Young at the
pipe?&#8221; he inquired. &#8220;That mystified everybody outside.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They both caught it coming down, but Hoover
lost his hold trying to change hands for tapping, and
Young dropped the knife he was knocking with, and
slipped fishing for it,&#8221; the fire-boss explained.
</p>
<p>Meantime at the entrance to the mine, a half hour
having passed without a knocking on the pipe to announce
the arrival inside of the young operator, anxiety
began to be felt for his safety also. When another
half hour had passed, and there was still no response
to frequent tappings of inquiry, the mine-boss, Bartlett,
began to stride up and down before the blocked
entrance. &#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t have allowed him to go in,&#8221;
he muttered repeatedly. &#8220;He was only a boy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>When at length Muskoka Jones reappeared on the
scene, and with him the operator from Ledges, Bartlett
met them with a gloomy face. At that very moment,
however, there was a shout from the men
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span>
gathered about the pumping-pipe. &#8220;He&#8217;s knocking!&#8221;
cried a voice.
</p>
<p>Bartlett, Muskoka and the Ledges operator went
forward on the run. The latter dropped to his knees
and placed his ear to the pipe. At the quick smile of
comprehension which came into his face a great cheer
went up. It was immediately stilled by a gesture from
the operator, and in tense silence he caught up a
stone, tapped back a signal, then read aloud Wilson&#8217;s
strangely telegraphed words of the safety of the men
below, their situation, and the means to be taken to
reach them.
</p>
<p>And just at sunset the bedraggled but joyful, cheering
party of rescuers and rescued emerged from the
entrance&mdash;Wilson to a reception he will remember
as long as he lives.
</p>
<p>The most important result of Wilson&#8217;s courage and
resourcefulness, however, was an interview Alex Ward
had that evening at Exeter with the division superintendent.
Following a recital of Wilson&#8217;s feat at the
mine, Alex added: &#8220;You said last week, Mr. Cameron,
that I might suggest a third operator for the
Yellow Creek construction &#8216;advance guard&#8217; of operators.
I&#8217;d like to suggest Jennings, sir.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He is appointed, then,&#8221; said the superintendent.
&#8220;Go and tell him yourself.&#8221;

<h2>XVIII</h2>
<h3>WITH THE CONSTRUCTION TRAIN</h3>
</div>

<p>On a newly-made siding parallel to the main-line
tracks, and in the center of a rolling vista of
yellow-brown prairie, stood a trampish-looking train
of weather-beaten passenger coaches and box-cars.
In the sides of the latter small windows had been cut,
and from the roofs projected chimneys. North of the
train, to a din of clanking, pounding and shoveling,
a throng of men were laying ties and rails, driving
spikes and tightening bolts, in the construction of
further short stretches of track.
</p>
<p>It was the Yellow Creek branch &#8220;boarding&#8221; and
construction train, and the laying of the sidings of the
newly-created Yellow Creek Junction was the first step
in the race of the Middle Western and the K. &amp; Z.,
some miles below the southern horizon, for the just-discernible
break to the southwest in the blue line of
the Dog Rib Mountains&mdash;the coveted entrance to
the new gold fields in the valley beyond.
</p>
<p>And here, the first of the construction operators
sent forward, Alex had been two days established in
the &#8220;telegraph-car.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span></p>
<p>As he had anticipated, Alex was enjoying the experience
hugely. It was every bit as good as camping
out, he had declared over the wire to Jack&mdash;having
for an office a table at one end of the old freight-car,
sleeping in a shelf-like bunk at the other end, and eating
in the rough-and-ready diner with the inspectors,
foremen, time-keepers and clerks who shared the telegraph-car
with him. As well, the work going on about
him was a constant source of interest during Alex&#8217;s
spare moments.
</p>
<p>On this, the second day, Alex had been particularly
interested in the newly-arrived track-laying machine&mdash;which
did not actually lay track at all, but by means
of roller-bottomed chutes fed out a stream of rails and
ties to the men ahead of it. After supper, the wire
being silent, Alex made his way amid several trains
of track-material already filling completed sidings, for
a closer view of the big machine.
</p>
<p>There proved to be less to see than he had expected;
and having climbed aboard the pilot-car and examined
the engine, Alex ascended the tower from which a
brakeman controlled the movements of the train.
</p>
<p>On his right lay a string of flats piled high with
timbers for bridges and culverts. Glancing along
them, Alex was surprised to see a man&#8217;s head cautiously
emerge from an opening in the lumber on one
of the cars, and quickly disappear on discovering him.
A moment after he had a fleeting glimpse of the intruder
running low along the side of the train toward
the rear.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Only a hobo,&#8221; Alex decided on second thought.
For numbers of tramps had come through on the
material-trains. And presently Alex returned to the
telegraph-car.
</p>
<p>Shortly after midnight the young operator was
awakened by someone running through the car and
shouting for Construction Superintendent Finnan.
When he caught the word &#8220;Fire!&#8221; he scrambled into
his clothes and leaped to the floor, and out.
</p>
<p>Over the tops of the cars in the direction of the
track-machine was a dancing glare.
</p>
<p>In alarm Alex joined the stream of men dropping
to the ground all along the boarding-cars. Dodging
through the intervening trains, he brought up with an
expression of relief beside, not the track-machine, but
a car of bridge material.
</p>
<p>Fanned by a brisk wind, flames were spouting from
amid the timbers at several points. Already men were
pitching the burning beams over the side, however;
and finding a shovel, Alex joined those who were
smothering them with sand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tramps, sure!&#8221; Alex heard another of the shovelers
remark angrily. Immediately then he recalled
the man he had seen from the track-machine
tower, and pausing in his work, he counted the cars
back.
</p>
<p>It was the same car. Yes; undoubtedly the fire was
the careless work of the tramp he had seen running
away.
</p>
<p>The force of fire fighters was rapidly augmented,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span>
and soon, despite the fresh breeze, the last of the burning
beams were smothered, and all danger of a general
conflagration was past.
</p>
<p>It was as Alex at last headed back for the boarding-train
that a theory other than the tramp theory of the
origin of the fire occurred to him. It came from a
sudden recollection of Division Superintendent Cameron&#8217;s
prediction of interference from the K. &amp; Z.
&#8220;Could that be the real explanation?&#8221; he asked himself
with some excitement.
</p>
<p>The first streak of dawn found Alex again at the
scene of the fire, bent on proving or disproving the
theory of incendiarism. Climbing aboard the scorched
car, he dropped to his knees and began carefully brushing
aside the sand with which the burning floor had
been covered.
</p>
<p>A few minutes&#8217; search produced the burned ends of
shavings!
</p>
<p>&#8220;So!&mdash;the &#8216;fight&#8217; is on!&#8221; observed Alex to himself
gravely.
</p>
<p>With several of the tell-tale fragments in his pocket
Alex was about to leap to the ground when Construction
Superintendent Finnan appeared. &#8220;Good morning,
my lad. You beat me here, eh?&#8221; he said genially.
&#8220;Well, what do you make of it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Alex sprang down beside him, and produced the
charred pine whittlings. &#8220;I found these on the bottom
of the car, sir. They don&#8217;t seem to support the careless
tramp theory, do they?&#8221; Continuing, Alex then
told of the man he had seen there the evening before.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span>
&#8220;Do you think it was the work of the K. &amp; Z., sir?&#8221;
he concluded.
</p>
<p>The superintendent&#8217;s lips were drawn tight. &#8220;Yes;
I believe it was. Could you identify the man?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am afraid not, sir. It was getting dusk, and he
was five or six car-lengths from me, and running
stooped over.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps we could follow his footsteps down the
side of the train?&#8221; Alex suggested.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good idea! Lead ahead. There has been a good
deal of tramping about, but we may pick them out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Proceeding to the point several cars distant at which
he had seen the stranger on the ground, Alex moved
on slowly, carefully inspecting the freshly turned but
considerably trampled earth, the superintendent following
him.
</p>
<p>A car-length beyond, the latter suddenly paused, retraced
his steps a few feet, and pointing out three
succeeding impressions, exclaimed, &#8220;I think we have
him, Ward! See? A long step! He was running
on his toes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Aided by the known length of the stride, they continued,
following the footprints with comparative ease.
Passing the second car from the end, they found the
steps shorten, then change to a walk. &#8220;Probably
turned in between this and the last car,&#8221; the superintendent
observed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; here they go,&#8221; announced Alex, halting at
the opening between the two flats. &#8220;He stood for a
moment, then went on through.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span></p>
<p>Alex and the superintendent followed, and continued
toward the rear of the last car. Half way Alex halted,
and with an ejaculation stooped and picked up something
white. &#8220;A small shaving, sir!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The official took it. &#8220;That decides the matter,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;Probably it was sticking to his clothes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He sat down here, for some time, did he not?&#8221;
Alex was pointing to a depression in the earth well
under the car, between two ties, and to the marks of
bootheels. The superintendent went to his knees and
closely examined the impressions left by the heels.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good! Look here,&#8221; he said with satisfaction.
&#8220;The marks of spurs! Our &#8216;tramp&#8217; was a horseman.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Alex turned to look about. &#8220;Where would he have
kept his horse?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Superintendent Finnan led the way beyond the cars
into the open. A mile distant, and hidden from the
boarding-train by the cars on the sidings, was a depression
in the prairie bordered with low scrub.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll have a look there,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>Some minutes later they stood in the bottom of the
miniature valley, beside the unmistakably fresh hoofprints
of a hobbled pony.
</p>
<p>The official was grimly silent as they retraced their
steps toward the construction-train. They had almost
reached it when Alex, who had been examining the
fragments of burned shavings, broke the silence.
&#8220;Mr. Finnan, let me see the bit of shaving we found
by the rear car, please.&#8221; There was a touch of excitement
in Alex&#8217;s voice, and the superintendent halted.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; he asked as he produced the whittling.
</p>
<p>Alex glanced at it, and smiling, placed it beside two
of the charred fragments in his hand. &#8220;Look at these
little ridges, sir! The same knife whittled them all.
The blade had two small nicks in it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;All we have to do now, sir, is to find the owner of
the knife!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A bright idea, Ward! Splendid!&#8221; exclaimed the
superintendent heartily.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; he added as they moved on, &#8220;how are we going
to find him? We can&#8217;t very well round up the whole
Dog Rib country, and hold a jack-knife inspection.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They came within sight of the bleached-out dining-cars.
Basking in the morning sun on the steps of one
of the old coaches was the figure of a young Indian,
who had come from no one knew where the first day
of their arrival, and had attached himself to the kitchen
department.
</p>
<p>Alex laid his hand on the superintendent&#8217;s arm.
&#8220;Mr. Finnan, why not try Little Hawk?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It occurred to me just as you spoke. I will.
Right now.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You go on in to breakfast, Ward,&#8221; he directed.
&#8220;And say nothing of our suspicions or discoveries.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well, sir.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The members of the telegraph-car party were leaving
for the diner as Alex appeared.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, Ward! Catch the early worm?&#8221; inquired
one of the track-foremen jocularly.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You mean, &#8216;did he shoot it?&#8217;&#8221; corrected a time-clerk.
</p>
<p>At this there was a general laugh, and glancing
about for an explanation, Alex saw Elder, Superintendent
Finnan&#8217;s personal clerk and aide de camp,
hastily remove a cartridge-belt and revolver from his
waist and toss them into his bunk.
</p>
<p>Elder was the one unpopular man in the telegraph-car.
An undersized, aggressively important individual,
just out of college, and affecting a stylish khaki
hunting-suit, natty leather leggings and a broad-brimmed
hat, he bore himself generally as though
second in importance only to the construction superintendent
himself. And naturally he had promptly been
made the butt of the party.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But you know,&#8221; gravely observed one of the inspectors,
as they took their places about the plain board
table in the dining-car, &#8220;some of these tramps are
dangerous fellows. They&#8217;d just as soon pull a gun
on you as borrow a dime. So there&#8217;s nothing like
being prepared. Particularly when one carries about
such evidence of wealth and rank as friend Elder,
here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>At the chuckles which followed the clerk bridled
angrily.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, anyway, Ryan,&#8221; he retorted, &#8220;I am ready
to fight if one of them interferes with me. I&#8217;ll not
stick up my hands and let him go through me, as you
did once.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you wouldn&#8217;t, eh?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No, I wouldn&#8217;t. In fact, I&#8217;d like to see anyone
make me throw up my hands, even if I didn&#8217;t have
a revolver,&#8221; Elder went on emphatically. &#8220;I&#8217;d rather
be shot&mdash;yes, sir, I&#8217;d rather be shot than have to
think afterward that I&#8217;d been such a weak-kneed coward.
And that&#8217;s what I think of any man who would
permit a low-down tramp to go through his pockets.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Loud applause greeted these remarks, clapping,
banging of plates, and cries of &#8220;Hear, hear!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Go it, Elder!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Show him up!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s on me. He has me labelled, OK,&#8221; admitted
Ryan with marked humility. &#8220;But then, gentlemen,
I protest it is hardly fair to compare an ordinary mortal
to so remarkably courageous a man as Elder. I
claim it is not given many men to be that fearless.
Why, &#8216;with half an eye,&#8217; as the old grammars say,
you can see courage sticking out all over him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, laugh. But I never showed the white
feather to a hobo,&#8221; Elder repeated scathingly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; but&mdash;what is it Kipling, or Shakespeare,
says?&mdash;&#8216;While there&#8217;s life there&#8217;s soap?&#8217;&#8221; observed
Ryan, a sudden twinkle appearing in his eye.
</p>
<p>The inspector explained the meaning of his facetiously
garbled quotation when Elder left the table.
The proposal he made was greeted with enthusiasm.
</p>
<p>Work had been started on the branch road itself that
morning, and on returning to the telegraph-car at noon
the superintendent&#8217;s clerk found most of the party there
before him, preparing for dinner. An animated debate
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span>
which was in progress ceased as he entered, and
someone exclaimed, &#8220;Here he is now. He&#8217;d soon
straighten them up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is the trouble, men?&#8221; inquired Elder, with
the air of a sergeant-major.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Our two head-spikers had a disagreement this
morning, and have gone across the yards to settle it,&#8221;
explained one of the time-keepers through his towel.
&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t you go after them, and interfere? They
may put each other out of commission. Refused to
listen to me or the foreman.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The childish idiots! Certainly,&#8221; agreed Elder,
turning back to the door. &#8220;Which way did they
go?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Straight across the yard. But hadn&#8217;t you better
take your gun?&#8221; the time-clerk suggested. &#8220;They
are a pair of pretty tough customers.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;perhaps I had, since you mention it,&#8221; Elder
responded. Going to his bunk, he secured and
buckled on the belt, drew the revolver from its holster
to examine it, and set forth grimly. As he disappeared
the men in the car broke into barely-subdued
splutterings of laughter, and crowding to the door,
waited expectantly.
</p>
<p>With an air of responsibility and determination the
clerk made his way between the adjacent cars. There
were six tracks filled with the long trains of construction
material. He had passed the fifth, and was stooping
beneath the couplings of two flats beyond, when
from the other side he heard footsteps.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span></p>
<p>One hand on the butt of his revolver, he leaped
forth. Uttering a choking cry he sprang back.
Within a foot of his eyes were the barrels of two big
Colt&#8217;s-pistols, and looking over the tops of them was
a villainous handkerchief-masked face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hands up!&#8221; ordered the tramp hoarsely.
</p>
<p>Elder&#8217;s hands flew into the air. Immediately, despite
his fright, there returned a remembrance of his
boast that morning. He half made as though to bring
his hands down. Instantly the cold muzzles of the
pistols were pressed close beneath his nose. With a
wild flutter Elder&#8217;s fingers shot upward to their fullest
stretch.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come out!&#8221; ordered the tramp.
</p>
<p>Quaking, and almost on tiptoes in his effort to keep
his hands aloft, Elder obeyed. Lowering one of the
pistols and thrusting it into his belt, the tramp reached
forward and secured the clerk&#8217;s revolver, dropping it
to the ground beneath his feet.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Mr. Superintendent,&#8221; he ordered gruffly,
&#8220;hand over your roll!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, I&#8217;m not the superintendent,&#8221; quavered Elder
hopefully. &#8220;I am&mdash;only a clerk.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Clerk nothing! Don&#8217;t you think I know a superintendent
when I see one? Out with those yellowbacks
you drew yesterday, or by gum&mdash;&#8221; The pistol
was again thrust under his nose, and Elder blanched.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;m not the superintendent! Honestly I&#8217;m
not!&#8221; he protested. &#8220;I&#8217;m only a clerk. And I only
get&mdash;only get&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, come on! You only get?&#8221; thundered the
tramp.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I only get thirty-five dollars a month,&#8221; whispered
the clerk.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Only thirty-five bones a month? Well, by gum!&#8221;
The tramp looked the shrinking clerk over with unspeakable
contempt. &#8220;Why, there ain&#8217;t a Dago
shoveler in the outfit doesn&#8217;t get more than that!
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well, then,&#8221; he conceded loftily. &#8220;You can
keep your coppers. I never let it be said I rob the
poor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I tell you what I will have,&#8221; he went on suddenly.
&#8220;Them clothes are sure too good for any
man not getting as much money as a Dago. These,&#8221;
indicating his own tattered and grimy garments, &#8220;are
more in your line. Come on! Peel off!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The trimly-dressed clerk stared aghast.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You surely&mdash;don&#8217;t mean&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I surely DO mean! <i>Shell off!</i>&#8221; roared the tramp.
</p>
<p>And utterly beyond belief as it was, ten minutes
later Elder was surveying himself in the unspeakable
rags of the hobo, and the latter, before him, was ridiculously
attired in his own natty, smaller garments.
</p>
<p>Having then removed Elder&#8217;s fancy Stetson and
clamped his own greasy and battered christy down to
the clerk&#8217;s ears, the tramp had one further humiliation.
Pointing to a clump of black, oily waste hanging from
a nearby axle-box, he ordered, &#8220;Pull out a bunch of
that!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Slowly, wondering, Elder did so.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No one would believe you were a genuine hobo
with such a scandalously clean face as that. Rub the
waste over it,&#8221; commanded the tramp.
</p>
<p>This was too much. Blindly Elder turned to escape.
Instantly both pistols were once more at his head. And
in final abject surrender he slowly rubbed the black
car-grease upon his cheeks.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very good. A little on the forehead now,&#8221; directed
the relentless tramp. &#8220;Now the ears.
</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Go on!</i>... Very good.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now you may go.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Frantically Elder spun about and dove between the
cars. As he did so, behind him roared out six quick
pistol shots.
</p>
<p>Blindly he scrambled under the next train. Shouts
rose ahead of him. &#8220;Help, help!&#8221; he cried.
&#8220;Tramps! Tramps! Help!&#8221;
</p>
<p>From the boarding-cars broke out a hubbub of excitement.
&#8220;Tramps! Tramps!&#8221; he shrilled, scuttling
beneath the third train.
</p>
<p>On the other side he suddenly pulled up. He had
forgotten his outlandish appearance! What if&mdash;
</p>
<p>Men sprang into view from between the cars farther
down. &#8220;Here he is!&#8221; they shouted, instantly heading
for him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s me! Elder!&#8221; cried the apparent tramp.
</p>
<p>More men appeared. &#8220;The tramp who burned the
car!&#8221; rose the cry. &#8220;Lynch him! Lynch him!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Elder dove back the way he had come. The trackmen
raced for the nearest openings, and dove after.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_308' name='page_308'></a>308</span></p>
<p>As Elder dashed for the next train several of his
pursuers sprang into view but a car-length away.
&#8220;Head him off! Don&#8217;t let him get away!&#8221; they
shouted.
</p>
<p>Madly Elder rushed on, darted beneath the last
string of flats, and on out into the open.
</p>
<p>A figure was approaching on horseback. He recognized
Superintendent Finnan. Uttering a cry of hope,
he headed for him. At sight of the desperately running
figure, with its grimy face and flapping rags, the
superintendent pulled up in sheer amazement. When
the stream of men broke through the train and poured
after, yelping like a pack of hounds, he urged his
horse forward.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Catch him! Stop him!&#8221; shouted the pursuers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s me! Elder!&#8221; screamed the clerk. &#8220;Elder!
Elder!&#8221;
</p>
<p>A big Irishman, a pick-handle in his hand, was gaining
on the supposed tramp at every bound, roaring,
&#8220;I&#8217;ll fix ye! I&#8217;ll fix ye, ye vermin!&#8221;
</p>
<p>With a last desperate sprint the flying clerk reached
the horse and threw himself at the superintendent&#8217;s
stirrups. &#8220;It&#8217;s Elder, Mr. Finnan!&#8221; he gasped.
&#8220;Elder! Elder!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The superintendent gazed down into the blackened
face an instant, then suddenly doubled up over his
horse&#8217;s head, rocking and shaking in a convulsion of
laughter. The action saved the clerk from the Irishman.
The descending pick-handle halted in mid-air,
the wielder gazed open-mouthed at the convulsed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_309' name='page_309'></a>309</span>
official, then suddenly grasping the clerk&#8217;s head,
twisted it about, and staggered back, roaring and
shouting at the top of his lungs. As fast as the others
arrived the riot of merriment increased; and when
presently the superintendent moved on toward the
train, the crestfallen clerk still at his stirrup, they were
the center of a hilariously howling mob.
</p>
<p>The final blow came when Elder entered the telegraph-car.
Carefully laid out in his bunk were the
garments he had surrendered to the &#8220;tramp.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The incident had its final good result, however.
The mangling of Elder&#8217;s vanity disclosed an unsuspected
streak of common-sense and manliness, and a
day or so after he frankly thanked Ryan, the perpetrator
of the joke, for &#8220;having put him right.&#8221; And
finally he became one of the most popular men on the
train.

<h2>XIX</h2>
<h3>THE ENEMY&#8217;S HAND AGAIN, AND A CAPTURE</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Good morning, Ward. Any word of the progress
made by the K. &amp; Z.?&#8221; inquired Construction
Superintendent Finnan the following morning,
Sunday, looking into the telegraph-car.
</p>
<p>Alex threw down his towel and stepped to the instrument
table. &#8220;Yes, sir; here&#8217;s one that came late
last night.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It says they started from Red Deer yesterday
morning, and made nearly three and a half miles.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The superintendent looked somewhat glum as he
read the message. &#8220;That beats us by half a mile,&#8221;
he remarked. &#8220;If the news is reliable, that is. They
may plan to give out inflated distances, in order to discourage
us. That would be a small matter to them,
after trying to burn us out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There has been no sign of Little Hawk yet, sir?&#8221;
Alex inquired.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No. I am beginning to think the rascal has gone
over to the K. &amp; Z.,&#8221; said the superintendent, turning
away. At the door he paused. &#8220;By the way, Ward,
remind me to give you a message to-morrow morning
asking for two more operators. We will have
made six or seven miles by Monday night, and will
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_311' name='page_311'></a>311</span>
be running the train down the branch. And the temporary
station is almost completed,&#8221; he added, glancing
from the window toward a box-car which had
been lifted from its trucks and placed on a foundation
of ties beside the main-line tracks.
</p>
<p>Alex promised gladly. It meant the coming of Jack
Orr and Wilson Jennings.
</p>
<p>Following breakfast, the morning being a beautiful
one, Alex determined on a walk, and set off along the
main-line to the west. Two miles distant he struck
a small bridge and a deep, dry creek-bed, and turning
south along its border, headed for the distant rail-head
of the new branch.
</p>
<p>At a bend in the creek some two hundred yards
from the track-machine and its string of flat-cars, Alex
sharply paused. Two saddled ponies were hobbled together
in the creek-bottom. Casting a glance toward
the construction-train, Alex leaped into the gully, out
of sight.
</p>
<p>He had not a doubt that the horses belonged to men
in the service of the K. &amp; Z., and that something was
on foot similar to the attempted burning of the bridge-car.
</p>
<p>What should he do? Return the three miles to the
junction? or continue on to the track-machine? For
undoubtedly the owners of the horses were there; and
the machine, he knew, was in the sole charge of an
oiler.
</p>
<p>Alex decided on the latter course, and making his
way along the bed of the stream, passed the hobbled
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_312' name='page_312'></a>312</span>
ponies, and on to the new bridge fifty feet in rear of
the construction-train.
</p>
<p>As he there halted, low voices reached Alex&#8217;s ears.
Peering cautiously out, and seeing no one, he crept
forth, and made his way along the side of the embankment
toward the train. A few feet from the rear
car Alex came upon a three-wheeled track velocipede,
used by Elder, the superintendent&#8217;s clerk in running
backwards and forwards between the rail-head and the
junction. Pausing, he debated whether he should not
put it on the rails, and make a run for the junction
immediately. Finally Alex concluded first to learn
something further of what was going on, and to count
on the velocipede as a means of making his escape in
case of emergency. To this end he proceeded cautiously
to place the little jigger in a position from
which he could quickly swing it onto the irons. Then
continuing forward under the edge of the train, he
reached the pilot-car.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; it&#8217;s a first class machine&mdash;the best on the
market.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The voice was that of the oiler. Apparently he had
been showing the strangers over the track-machine.
For a brief space Alex wondered whether after all
his suspicions were justified. But at once came the
thought, &#8220;Why had the strangers hidden their horses
in the creek-bottom if they were genuine visitors?&#8221;
and he remained quiet.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is the boiler?&#8221; inquired a new voice, evidently
one of the owners of the horses.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_313' name='page_313'></a>313</span></p>
<p>&#8220;There is none. The steam comes from the engine,
behind,&#8221; the oiler responded. &#8220;Here&mdash;it comes
in here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So! And does the machine get out of order very
easily?&#8221; asked a second voice.
</p>
<p>There was something in the tone that caused Alex
to prick up his ears.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Almost never. It&#8217;s all simple. Nothing intricate,&#8221;
the man in charge replied.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose it could be put out of order, though&mdash;say,
you fellows were to go on strike, and wanted to
disable things? Eh?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh! That&#8217;s rather a funny question. But I
suppose it could. Anything could, for that matter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do they pay you, as oiler?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, what are you two fellows driving at?&#8221; the
oiler demanded sharply.
</p>
<p>There was a momentary silence, during which Alex
imagined the two strangers looking questioningly at
one another. Then one of them spoke.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Look here, whatever you get, we will give you a
hundred dollars a month extra to put this machine
out of order two or three times a week. Nothing very
bad, but just enough to lose two or three hours&#8217; work
each time. We are&mdash;well, never mind who we are.
The thing stands this way: We have a big bet on that
the K. &amp; Z. will win in this building race for Yellow
Creek, and&mdash;well, you see the point, I guess. What
do you say?&#8221;
</p>
<p>During the pause that followed Alex waited breathlessly,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_314' name='page_314'></a>314</span>
and with growing disappointment. Was the
oiler considering the bribe?
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said the oiler at length, &#8220;is that your best
offer? Couldn&#8217;t you make it a thousand?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A thousand! Nonsense&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Two thousand, then.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just this!&#8221; cried the oiler, and simultaneously
there was a rush of feet and a sound of blows. Exultingly
Alex was scrambling forth to go to the oiler&#8217;s
assistance, when just above him was a crash of falling
bodies, and a figure bounded over the side of the
car and rolled sprawling down the embankment.
</p>
<p>It was the plucky oiler, and Alex shrank back in
horror as the man came to a stop flat on his back, and
lay immovable, blood trickling from a wound over his
eyes.
</p>
<p>Overhead was the sound of someone getting to their
feet. &#8220;He nearly got you,&#8221; said a voice.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nearly. But I guess I &#8216;got him&#8217; one better.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is he safe for awhile, do you think?&#8221;
</p>
<p>As the two men moved to the edge of the car and
apparently gazed down at the prostrate figure in the
ditch, Alex shrank back with apprehension on his own
account.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps we&#8217;d better make sure of him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right. Here is a bit of rope.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Hurriedly Alex crawled beneath the nearby truck,
behind the wheels, and a tall figure in the garb of a
cowboy dropped to the ground before him and ran
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_315' name='page_315'></a>315</span>
down to the still unconscious oiler. Binding the prostrate
man&#8217;s feet together at the ankles, the cowman
turned the oiler on his face, and secured his hands
behind his back. Turning him again face up, he studied
his eyes a moment, and announcing, &#8220;Good job.
Only stunned,&#8221; he returned to the car and drew himself
up on it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now what&#8217;ll we do?&#8221; inquired his companion.
&#8220;That idiot has knocked our plans to pieces. We
can&#8217;t go back and say we neither made the deal, nor
did anything else for our money.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have to tear things up ourselves,&#8221; said the
first man decisively. &#8220;Let us see what we can do in
the engine-room here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The footsteps passed into the engine-house, and
Alex at once crawled forth, to make his way back
to the velocipede.
</p>
<p>As he emerged from beneath the car he paused to
glance down at the prostrate oiler. Should he leave
him lying there? It did not seem right, despite the
obvious necessity of heading for the junction without
a moment&#8217;s delay.
</p>
<p>As he hesitated, the eyes of the prostrate man flickered,
and opened. Alex dodged back, lest the oiler
should betray his presence to the men on the car. As
he dropped down there came the recollection that there
were two seats on the velocipede. Why not take the
man with him, if he sufficiently recovered? Good!
</p>
<p>Anxiously Alex watched as the stunned man blinked
about him. Finally comprehension, then a hot flush of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_316' name='page_316'></a>316</span>
rage appeared in the oiler&#8217;s face, and with a violent
kick he twisted about toward the car.
</p>
<p>Springing into view, Alex caught the oiler&#8217;s startled
eye, and made a warning gesture. The man stared
dully for a moment, then nodded, and on Alex&#8217;s
further urgent signalling, dropped back and again
closed his eyes. Alex produced and opened his jack-knife.
</p>
<p>The men above were busily fumbling about in the
engine-room. Only pausing to make sure they were
entirely occupied, Alex slipped forth, cautiously crept
down the embankment, reached the bound man, and
with a slash of the knife freed his feet and hands.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us slip back to the velocipede&mdash;it&#8217;s ready to
throw on the rails&mdash;and make a dash of it for the
junction,&#8221; Alex whispered. The oiler arose, and with
one eye on the engine-room door they crept up under
the edge of the car, and on toward the rear of the
train.
</p>
<p>They reached the little track-car, and cautiously
lifted it onto the rails.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Better push it a ways,&#8221; the oiler advised in a low
voice. &#8220;They might hear the rumble, with our weight
on it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Gently they set the velocipede in motion. With the
first move one of the wheels gave forth a shrill screech.
The two paused as the sounds on the pilot-car immediately
ceased.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If we hear one of them going to the edge to look
for me, we&#8217;ll make a run of it,&#8221; said the oiler.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_317' name='page_317'></a>317</span></p>
<p>&#8220;They may go on tiptoe,&#8221; Alex pointed out.
</p>
<p>The suggestion was followed by a sharp exclamation
from the head of the train. &#8220;The oiler&#8217;s gone!&#8221;
cried a voice. Simultaneously there was the sound of
someone springing to the ground, and Alex and the
oiler scrambled into the velocipede seats, Alex facing
the rear, and threw themselves against the handles.
The oilless wheel again screeched, and from the pilot-car
rose the cry, &#8220;Around at the end! Quick!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Alex and the oiler wrenched the handles backwards
and forwards with all their might, and the little car
leaped ahead. Before they had gained full headway,
however, one of the machine-wreckers appeared about
the end of the train, and with a cry to his companion,
dashed after. He ran like a deer, and despite the
increasing speed of the velocipede, quickly gained
upon them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll get us!&#8221; Alex exclaimed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The creek bridge is just ahead. That&#8217;ll stop him,&#8221;
said the oiler.
</p>
<p>The second man appeared, and joined in the chase.
</p>
<p>The first runner saw the bridge, and redoubled his
efforts. In spite of their best endeavors, he drew
rapidly nearer. A hand shot out to clutch the oiler&#8217;s
shoulder.
</p>
<p>It reached him&mdash;and with a rumble they were on
and over the bridge, and their pursuer had sprawled
forward flat on his face.
</p>
<p>He was on his feet again like a wildcat, however,
and crossing the bridge three ties at a time, leaped to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_318' name='page_318'></a>318</span>
the flat ground beside the track, and was again after
the velocipede like a race-horse.
</p>
<p>Try as they would, Alex and the oiler could get no
more speed out of the low-geared machine, and with
alarm Alex saw the runner once more drawing near.
The second man they had outdistanced.
</p>
<p>Closer the cowman came. &#8220;Stop!&#8221; he shouted.
&#8220;Stop! You may as well! I&#8217;ve got you!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Determinedly they held on, working the handles
desperately, Alex watching the grim, clean-shaven face
and the fluttering dotted handkerchief about the pursuing
man&#8217;s neck with a curious fascination.
</p>
<p>At last he was parallel with them. Still running,
he drew his revolver. &#8220;Stop!&#8221; he ordered. &#8220;Stop,
or I&#8217;ll put one through you!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep it up, boy,&#8221; the oiler directed sharply. &#8220;He
daresn&#8217;t fire. He daresn&#8217;t add murder to it. And he&#8217;d
be heard at the junction.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The runner snapped his gun back into its holster,
and putting on an extra spurt, rushed slanting up the
embankment, and threw himself bodily upon the oiler.
They tumbled off backwards in a struggling heap.
Throwing his weight against the handles, Alex stopped
the velocipede, sprang off, and dashed to the oiler&#8217;s
assistance.
</p>
<p>The cowman&#8217;s revolver had fallen from his belt.
Alex caught it up and pressed it against the back of
the man&#8217;s head. &#8220;Stop it! Let go!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
certainly shoot!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The man half relaxed, and glared up sideways.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_319' name='page_319'></a>319</span>
Alex brought the muzzle to his eyes, and slowly he
freed his hold on the oiler. &#8220;Oh, very well,&#8221; he muttered
with a curse. &#8220;You win.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No&mdash;don&#8217;t!&#8221; said Alex, as the enraged oiler
spun about to strike the half-prostrate man. &#8220;He&#8217;s
down, and has given up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>At that moment interruption came from another
quarter. It was a shrill cry from the direction of the
creek-bed, and turning, all three saw a round-shouldered
figure on horseback scrambling from the creek-bottom,
leading the ponies of the two would-be wreckers,
and the second cowman running toward him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Little Hawk!&#8221; Alex exclaimed.
</p>
<p>The cowboy reached the Indian, sprang at him,
there was a terrific scrimmage, and the white man
sprang from the melee with the bridle of one of the
ponies, leaped into the saddle, and was off across the
prairie in a whirl of dust.
</p>
<p>So interested had Alex been in the second conflict
that momentarily he had forgotten the man on the
ground before him. He was reminded by suddenly
finding himself sprawling upon his back, and regaining
his feet, found their prisoner also racing off at
top speed. The oiler darted after, but quickly gave
it up. He was no match for the light-footed cowman.
</p>
<p>Seeing the pistol still in Alex&#8217;s hand, he cried,
&#8220;Shoot! Shoot him!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Alex raised the revolver, faltered, and lowered it.
&#8220;No. I can&#8217;t,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can!&#8221; The oiler darted back and wrested it
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_320' name='page_320'></a>320</span>
from Alex&#8217;s hand. As he whirled about to fire, Alex
grasped his arm. &#8220;No! Wait! Look!&#8221; he exclaimed.
&#8220;The Indian is after him!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Turning, the oiler saw the Indian, with his own and
one of the other ponies, storming across the ground in
pursuit of the runner. Silently they watched.
</p>
<p>As he heard the pounding hoofs behind him, the
fleeing cowboy glanced about, and set on at greater
speed than ever. Quickly, however, the horses cut
down the distance between them.
</p>
<p>The Indian leaned toward the second pony, took
something from the saddle-horn, and began to adjust
it on his arm.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s going to lassoo him!&#8221; said Alex breathlessly.
</p>
<p>Nearer drew the Indian to the fleeing man, and
hand and lassoo went into the air and began to weave
circles. Tensely the two on the embankment watched.
</p>
<p>Closer the horses drew. Wider the circle of the
lassoo extended.
</p>
<p>Suddenly it leaped through the air like a great snake.
The runner saw the shadow of it, and with a cry that
they heard, half turned and threw out his arms to
ward it off. The loop was too large, the cowman
missed it, and as the Indian pulled up in a cloud of
dust, he whipped in the slack, and the noose tightened
fairly about the renegade&#8217;s waist. An instant after,
however, the second pony, plunging ahead of the Indian&#8217;s,
threw the rider forward, slackening the lariat.
In a twinkle the cowman had loosened the noose, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_321' name='page_321'></a>321</span>
was wriggling out of it. He had freed one foot before
the Indian had recovered himself. Then with a terrific
yank the horseman snapped in the slack, the cowman&#8217;s
feet flew from under him, and with one foot
taut in the air, caught at the ankle, he lay cursing and
shaking an impotent fist.
</p>
<p>As Alex and the oiler ran forward the Indian sat
on his horse like a statue, holding the lariat taut.
</p>
<p>The oiler reached the prisoner first, revolver in hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Get up, you!&#8221; he ordered. Sullenly the man
obeyed. Removing a handkerchief from about his
neck, the oiler gave it to Alex, who securely bound the
man&#8217;s hands behind him. Throwing off the lassoo,
they turned toward the Indian. With some wonder,
they saw he was carefully examining the hoofs of the
pony he was leading. Concluding the inspection with
a grunt, he came forward, winding up the rope, and
halted before them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You hoss?&#8221; he asked of the prisoner, pointing
over his shoulder.
</p>
<p>The cowboy looked at him contemptuously, and
responded, &#8220;Well, what if it is, Old Ugly-Mug?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The oiler brought up the pistol. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know
why he wants to know, but you go ahead and tell
him!&#8221; he ordered threateningly. &#8220;He&#8217;s twice the
man you are. Is it your horse?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Little Hawk turned away with a grunt of satisfaction,
and mounting his pony, rode off towards the
junction.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_322' name='page_322'></a>322</span></p>
<p>What the Indian meant Alex learned when, with
their prisoner between them, he and the oiler approached
the boarding-train, and met Little Hawk returning
with Superintendent Finnan.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That him!&#8221; said the Indian briefly as they drew
near. &#8220;Him burn cars!&#8221;
</p>
<p>From the prisoner came a hissing gasp. As Alex
turned upon him with a sharp ejaculation of understanding,
however, the man assumed an indifferent
air, and strode on nonchalantly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you want?&#8221; he demanded insolently of
the superintendent. &#8220;Can&#8217;t a man pull off a&mdash;a
little joke without these idiots of yours going out of
their heads? It was nothing more than a bit of fun
me and my mate was having,&#8221; he affirmed boldly.
</p>
<p>Superintendent Finnan smiled sardonically. &#8220;That
is what the K. &amp; Z. call it, eh?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Alex, still with a hand on the prisoner&#8217;s arm, felt
him start. But brazenly the man replied, &#8220;K. &amp; Z.?
What&#8217;s the K. &amp; Z.? A ranch brand? I never heard
of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>On a thought Alex stepped forward and whispered
a word in the official&#8217;s ear.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Go ahead,&#8221; said the superintendent.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to search your pockets,&#8221; Alex announced,
stepping back to the side of the renegade
cowman. &#8220;No objection, I suppose, since you don&#8217;t
know what K. &amp; Z. means?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Search ahead,&#8221; agreed the prisoner, half smiling.
&#8220;And good luck to you if you find anything to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_323' name='page_323'></a>323</span>
connect me&mdash;if you find anything,&#8221; he corrected
quickly.
</p>
<p>From a trouser pocket Alex drew out a large jack-knife.
With a suspicion of trembling he opened one
of the blades and examined it, while the owner regarded
him curiously. With a shake of the head the
young operator opened the second blade. A quick
smile of triumph lit up his face, and delving into a
vest pocket, he brought forth a scrap of paper, unfolded
it, and took out a fragment of charred pine
shaving.
</p>
<p>Turning his back on the now anxiously watching,
though still puzzled, owner of the knife, he held the
shaving against the edge of the blade. The superintendent
bent over it, and uttered a delighted &#8220;Exactly!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Triumphantly Alex turned toward the prisoner, and
held the hand with the knife and shaving before him.
&#8220;Does this help you to recall what K. &amp; Z. means?&#8221;
he asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Recall? I don&#8217;t&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;See these two little ridges on the shaving? See
these two little nicks in the blade?&#8221;
</p>
<p>With a hoarse cry the man flung himself backward,
and bound as he was, began struggling like a madman.
Alex, the superintendent and the Indian were to the
oiler&#8217;s assistance in a twinkle, however, and a few
minutes later saw the renegade in their midst on the
way to the boarding-train&mdash;and, as it finally proved,
to the jail at Exeter.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_324' name='page_324'></a>324</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know who to thank most,&#8221; said Superintendent
Finnan later&mdash;&#8220;you, Ward, or the oiler, or
Little Hawk. Nor what appreciation to suggest higher
up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You might make it a blanket and Winchester for
the Indian, and a purse for the oiler, for the knocks he
got and the bribe he refused,&#8221; Alex suggested.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And yourself?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, just let me keep the rascal&#8217;s knife, as a memento,&#8221;
responded Alex modestly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well; we&#8217;ll agree on that&mdash;for the present,&#8221;
said the superintendent.

<h3>A PRISONER</h3>
</div>

<p>When the early-morning mail train stopped at
Yellow Creek Junction on Tuesday, Alex was
at the little box-car station to greet Jack Orr and
Wilson Jennings. Jack, who had not met Wilson
before the latter boarded the train at Bonepile, had
taken a liking to the easterner at once, and confided
to Alex that he was &#8220;the real goods,&#8221; despite the
&#8220;streak of dude.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We ought to have some good times together,&#8221;
Jack predicted, as, with lively interest, he and Wilson
accompanied Alex back toward the nondescript but
businesslike-looking boarding-train.
</p>
<p>Jack&#8217;s hope, as far as it concerned the three boys
being together, was soon shattered. As they reached
the telegraph-car, Superintendent Finnan appeared,
and having cordially shaken hands with Jack and
Wilson, turned to Alex. &#8220;Ward,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I have
just decided to send you on to the Antelope viaduct.
A courier has brought word from Norton, the engineer
in charge, that trouble appears to be brewing
amongst his Italian laborers, and I would like to get
in direct touch with him. The telegraph line was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_326' name='page_326'></a>326</span>
strung within two miles of the bridge yesterday, and
should reach Norton&#8217;s camp to-day. How soon could
you start?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;As soon as I have breakfast, sir,&#8221; responded Alex,
stifling his disappointment. &#8220;It&#8217;s twenty miles there,
isn&#8217;t it, Mr. Finnan? How am I to go?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can ride a horse?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Elder will have a pony here for you by the time
you are ready. And you had better take an extra
blanket with you,&#8221; advised the superintendent as he
turned away. &#8220;You will be living in a tent, you
know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Half an hour later Alex, mounted on a spirited little
cow-pony, with a few necessities in a sweater, strapped
to the saddle, and a blanket over his shoulder, army
fashion, waved a good-by to Jack and Wilson, and
was off over the prairie at a lope, following the telegraph
poles.
</p>
<p>It was a beautiful morning, and with the sun shining
and the sparkling air brushing his cheeks and
tingling in his nostrils, Alex quickly forgot his disappointment
at being so quickly separated from Jack and
Wilson, and soon was enjoying every minute of his
ride. Keeping on steadily at a hand-gallop, before he
realized he had covered half the distance, he came upon
the wire-stringing and pole-erecting gangs. A half
mile farther, a long, dark break appeared in the plain,
and a muffled din of pounding began to reach him.
And pushing ahead, Alex drew up on the brink of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_327' name='page_327'></a>327</span>
a wide, deep gully, from either side of which reached
out a great wooden frame, dotted with busy men.
</p>
<p>It was the bed of the old Antelope river, which
years before had changed its course, and which the
railroad finally proposed crossing with a permanent
fill.
</p>
<p>Directly below, in a group of shrubby trees on the
border of the stony creek which alone remained of
the river, was a village of white tents. From Alex&#8217;s
feet a rough trail slanted downward toward it. Giving
his pony free rein, he descended.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is Mr. Norton?&#8221; he asked of a water-boy
at the foot of the path.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s him at the table in front of the middle
tent,&#8221; the boy directed. Thanking him, Alex urged
the pony forward, and leaped to the ground beside a
dark-haired, energetic young man bending over a sheet
of figures.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am the operator Mr. Finnan sent on,&#8221; Alex announced
as the engineer looked up.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Glad to meet you,&#8221; said the engineer, cordially
rising and extending his hand. &#8220;You are a trifle
young for this rough work, though, are you not?&#8221;
he ventured, noting Alex&#8217;s youthful face. &#8220;You are
not the operator who caught that K. &amp; Z. man Sunday?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I helped catch him,&#8221; Alex corrected.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll do, then,&#8221; said Norton. &#8220;And I&#8217;ll give
you a place here in my own tent,&#8221; he added, turning
and entering a small marquee, followed by Alex.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_328' name='page_328'></a>328</span></p>
<p>&#8220;This corner will be yours, and the box your &#8216;office.&#8217;
It will do for the instruments?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Fine,&#8221; responded Alex.
</p>
<p>As the wire-stringing gang was not due to reach
the viaduct before mid-afternoon, on completing his
arrangements in the tent, Alex set out for a tour of
his new surroundings. Climbing up the western slope
of the gully, he found a large gang of foreigners,
mostly Italians, working in a cutting. Judging that
this was the gang which was causing the anxiety, Alex
paused some moments to watch them.
</p>
<p>Scattered over a system of miniature track, the men
were shovelling earth into strings of small dump-cars,
which when filled were run out over the completed
western end of the viaduct, and dumped. As Alex
stood regarding the active scene, a string of cars rumbled
toward him from one of the more distant sidings.
Others had been pushed by several men. This was
being driven by a single burly giant. With admiration
Alex watched. Suddenly a sense of something
familiar about the figure stirred within him. The man
came opposite, and Alex uttered an involuntary ejaculation.
It was Big Tony, the Italian who had led the
trouble amongst the trackmen at Bixton two years
back, and with whom he had had the thrilling encounter
at the old brick-yard.
</p>
<p>When the Italian glanced toward him, Alex started
back. But the foreigner did not recognize the young
operator, with his two years of rapid growth, and
passed on. Breathing a sigh of relief, Alex turned
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_329' name='page_329'></a>329</span>
and made his way to the foreman in charge of the
gang.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you do,&#8221; he said, introducing himself.
&#8220;Who is that big Italian pushing the string of cars
alone?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tony Martino. The best man in the gang,&#8221;
responded the foreman. &#8220;Why? Do you know
him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He was on a surfacing-gang near my father&#8217;s station
two years ago,&#8221; said Alex, &#8220;and caused no end
of trouble. He was discharged finally.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He must have reformed, then,&#8221; the foreman declared.
&#8220;He&#8217;s certainly the best man we have&mdash;more
than willing, and strong as an ox.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He had nothing to do with the trouble you have
had here, then?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He helped me put it down,&#8221; said the foreman.
&#8220;No; I only wish we had a few more like him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Alex passed on, thoughtful. At Bixton Big Tony
had been no more remarkable for his willingness to
work than for his peaceableness. Had he really
changed for the better? Or was it possible he was
&#8220;playing possum,&#8221; to cover the carrying-out of some
plan of revenge against the road?
</p>
<p>Three evenings later, a beautiful, moonlit night,
Alex left the camp for a stroll. To obtain a look up
and down the old river-bed by the moonlight, he made
his way out on the now nearly completed viaduct.
</p>
<p>As he stood gazing down the ravine to the south,
a half-mile distant a dark figure passed over a bright
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_330' name='page_330'></a>330</span>
patch of sand. It was quickly lost in the dark background
beyond. But not before Alex had recognized
the unmistakable figure and walk of the Italian, Big
Tony. His suspicions at once awakened, Alex was
but a moment in deciding to follow the foreigner, and
returning to the eastern bank, he scrambled down to
the gully bottom, and hastily followed, keeping well
in the shadows on the eastern side of the ravine.
</p>
<p>Reaching the spot at which he had seen the Italian,
he went on more cautiously. A quarter-mile farther
the ravine swung abruptly to the west. As Alex arrived
at the bend, subdued voices reached him. Continuing
cautiously, and keeping to the deepest shadows,
Alex reached a clump of willow bushes.
</p>
<p>He glanced beyond, and in a patch of moonlight
discovered Big Tony in conversation with an almost
equally tall stranger, apparently a cowboy. The latter&#8217;s
back was toward him.
</p>
<p>The stranger turned, and Alex drew back with a
start, and then a smile.
</p>
<p>It was the second man of the two who on the previous
Sunday had attempted to wreck the track-machine&mdash;the
one who had made his escape.
</p>
<p>As the man turned more fully, and he caught his
words, Alex&#8217;s jubilant smile vanished.
</p>
<p>&#8220;... enough to blow the whole thing to matchwood,
if you place it right,&#8221; he was saying.
</p>
<p>There was no doubt what this meant. They were
planning to blow up the viaduct.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I fixa it alla right, alla right,&#8221; declared Big
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_331' name='page_331'></a>331</span>
Tony confidently. &#8220;No fear. I usa da dynamite all-aready.
I blow up da beega da house once.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A house and a big wooden bridge are quite different
propositions. And a wooden bridge isn&#8217;t to be
blown up like a stone or iron affair, you know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Suppose you come, taka da look, see my plan all-aright,
den,&#8221; the Italian suggested. &#8220;No one on disa
side da bridge, to see, disa time night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The cowman hesitated. &#8220;Well, all right. It would
be best to make sure.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t want to carry this, though. Where&#8217;ll
we put it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>As he spoke the man leaned over and picked up a
good-sized parcel done up in brown paper. From the
careful way he handled it there could be no doubt of
its contents. It was the dynamite they proposed
using.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here, I fin&#8217; da place.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Alex caught his breath at the display of carelessness
with which the foreigner took the deadly package.
Backing into a nearby clump of bushes, Big Tony
stooped and placed the dynamite on the ground, well
beneath the branches.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dere. No one see dat. Come!&#8221;
</p>
<p>As the two conspirators strode toward him, Alex
crept closer into the shadows of the willows. Passing
almost within touch of him, they continued up the
gully, and soon were out of sight.
</p>
<p>Before the footsteps of the two men had died away
Alex was sitting upright, debating a suggestion that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_332' name='page_332'></a>332</span>
caused him to smile. With decision he arose, approached
the bush under which the dynamite was concealed,
and reaching beneath with both hands, very
carefully brought the package forth and placed it on
the ground in the moonlight. With great caution he
then undid the twine securing the parcel, and opened
it. On discovering a second wrapping of paper within,
he uttered an exclamation of satisfaction. Lifting out
the inner parcel intact, he glanced about, and choosing
a group of bushes some distance away, carried the
dynamite there and concealed it. Returning, he secured
the piece of outer wrapping paper, and proceeded
to carry out his idea.
</p>
<p>Where the moonlight struck the western wall of the
gully was a bed of cracked, sun-baked clay. Making
his way thither, Alex found a fragment a little larger
than the package of dynamite, and with his knife proceeded
to trim it into a square. Carefully then he
wrapped this in the brown paper, and wound it about
with the cord just as the original parcel was secured.
And with a smile Alex placed this under the bush
from which he had taken the genuine package.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dynamite with that as much as you please, Mr.
Tony,&#8221; he laughed as he turned away.
</p>
<p>When Alex had covered half the distance in returning
to the viaduct he began keeping a sharp lookout
ahead for the returning of the Italian and his companion.
He was within a hundred yards of the great white
structure when he discovered them. Turning aside,
he concealed himself behind a small spruce.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_333' name='page_333'></a>333</span></p>
<p>With no apprehension of danger Alex waited, and
the two men came opposite. Suddenly, without a
motion of warning, the two turned and darted toward
him, one on either side of the tree. Before Alex had
recovered from his astonishment he found himself
seized on either side, and threateningly ordered to be
silent.
</p>
<p>They dragged him on some distance, then into the
moonlight. &#8220;Why, it&#8217;s one of the fellows who captured
Bucks on Sunday!&#8221; declared the cowboy.
&#8220;What are you doing here, boy?&#8221; he demanded angrily.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was out for a moonlight stroll,&#8221; Alex responded,
stifling his apprehension.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why did you hide behind that tree, then?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;perhaps I was afraid,&#8221; said Alex vaguely.
&#8220;There are some rough people here among the foreign
laborers.&#8221;
</p>
<p>As he spoke Alex noted with new alarm that the
Italian was regarding him sharply. He turned his
back more fully to the moonlight. Immediately he
chided himself for his stupidity. The move emphasized
the struggling sense of recognition in the Italian&#8217;s
mind, he smartly turned Alex&#8217;s face full to the moon,
and uttered a cry in Italian.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now I know! I know!&#8221; he cried exultingly. &#8220;I
know heem before! And he a spy! A boy spy!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Rapidly he gave the stranger a distorted account of
the strike at Bixton, and Alex&#8217;s part in his final discomfiture.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_334' name='page_334'></a>334</span></p>
<p>The cowman listened closely. &#8220;Is that so, boy?&#8221;
he demanded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Partly. But it was not a strike. It was a simple
piece of murderous revenge against one man, the
section-foreman. And I helped spoil it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good. That&#8217;s all I want to know,&#8221; said the cowboy
with decision. &#8220;Not that I care one way or the
other about the affair itself. It shows you are a dangerous
man to leave around loose. I&#8217;ll just take you
along with me. Come on!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come? Where?&#8221; said Alex, holding back in
alarm.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind! Just come!&#8221; Securing a new hold
on Alex&#8217;s arms, the speaker and the Italian dragged
him with them back down the gorge.
</p>
<p>As they neared the spot at which the dynamite was
supposed to be safely hidden, the stranger halted abruptly,
studied Alex intently a moment, then sent Big
Tony on ahead, after a whispered word in his ear.
</p>
<p>Alex knew the foreigner had gone to learn whether
the dynamite had been touched. In suspense he
awaited the result. Would the Italian be deceived?
Would he notice the new footprints about the bush?
</p>
<p>Big Tony returned. &#8220;All-aright,&#8221; he announced.
Alex breathed a sigh of relief, and continued forward
with his captors.
</p>
<p>They proceeded some distance in silence, and presently
Alex had sufficiently plucked up courage to again
ask what they proposed doing with him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to take you where you will be out of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_335' name='page_335'></a>335</span>
mischief, that&#8217;s all,&#8221; replied the unknown cowman.
As he spoke he halted, looked about, and resigning
Alex to the guardianship of the Italian, disappeared
in the shadow of an over-hang of the ravine. A moment
later there was a clatter of hoofs, and he reappeared
leading a horse.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Make heem rida too?&#8221; questioned Big Tony.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hardly,&#8221; responded the cowman, at the same time
freeing and swinging a lariat from the saddle-horn.
&#8220;He&#8217;s going to trot along behind me like the blame
little coyote he is.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold out your hands, kid!&#8221; he ordered. Seeing
resistance was useless, Alex reluctantly complied.
Running the noose of the lassoo about the boy&#8217;s wrists,
the cowman tightened it, and secured it with several
knots. Swinging into the saddle, he fixed the other
end to the saddle-horn.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You may go now, Tony,&#8221; he said to the foreigner
as he caught up the reins and headed the pony toward
a path to the surface which Alex had not noticed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Gooda night, Meester Munson. And gooda-by,
smart boy,&#8221; said the Italian. &#8220;Lucky for you I havanta
my way. &#8216;Scrugk!&#8217; That&#8217;s what you get,&#8221; he
declared, drawing his hand across his throat.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Munson, eh?&#8221; murmured Alex as the lassoo
tightened, and he stumbled up the path behind the
pony. &#8220;That&#8217;s another good thing learned.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Arrived at the surface, his captor halted to look
about, then set off across the plains due south, at a
walk, Alex trailing after at the end of the rope.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_336' name='page_336'></a>336</span></p>
<p>The situation was not without its humorous side,
it occurred to Alex after his first apprehension had
worn off. When a few minutes later the pony broke
into a slow canter, and he was forced into an awkward
dog-trot, a chuckle broke from him.
</p>
<p>The man ahead turned in surprise. &#8220;Well, you&#8217;re
sure a game one,&#8221; he observed. &#8220;Imagine it&#8217;s funny,
eh?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was thinking how I would look to some of my
friends, if they could see me here,&#8221; explained Alex
good-naturedly. &#8220;Trotting along like a little dog on
a string.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The cowman pulled up and laughed. &#8220;Youngster,
you&#8217;re all right,&#8221; he said heartily. &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry you&#8217;re&mdash;that is&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;On the wrong side?&#8221; suggested Alex, smiling.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well. Let it go at that. Look here! If
I take that thing off, will you promise to come along,
and not play any tricks?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I will,&#8221; agreed Alex readily. For he saw
there was little chance of making his escape from the
horseman on an open plain.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold up your hands, then,&#8221; directed the cowboy.
Alex complied, and quickly he was free.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How far are we going?&#8221; he asked as they moved
on, Alex walking abreast.
</p>
<p>&#8220;About twenty miles,&#8221; replied the cowman.

<h2>XXI</h2>
<h3>TURNING THE TABLES</h3>
</div>

<p>The moonlight had given place to darkness, and
Alex was thoroughly exhausted from his long
walk when the fence of a corral, then a group of small
buildings, loomed up, and his captor announced that
they were at their destination.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you live here all alone?&#8221; Alex asked, seeing
no lights.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Since you fellows captured Bucks&mdash;yes,&#8221; responded
the cowboy, halting at the corral bars. Dismounting,
he whipped saddle and bridle from the pony
as it passed inside, and replacing the bars, led the way
to the house.
</p>
<p>It was a small, meagerly-furnished room that a
match, then a lamp, disclosed. Against the rear wall
was a small stove, in the center a rough table, at either
end a low cot, and in one corner a cupboard. Two or
three chairs, some pictures and calendars and two or
three saddles completed the contents. The floor was
of hard earth.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;ll be your bunk there,&#8221; said the owner, indicating
one of the cots. &#8220;And you can turn in just
as soon as you like.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Crossing the room, he stood at the foot of the bed,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_338' name='page_338'></a>338</span>
thinking. &#8220;What&#8217;s the trouble? It looks comfortable
enough,&#8221; observed Alex, following.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have it,&#8221; said the cowman, and going to the saddles,
he returned with a coiled lariat. Alex laughed
uncomfortably.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lie down,&#8221; the man directed. &#8220;Or, hold on!
Let&#8217;s see first if you have any knives about you.&#8221; Objection
would have been fruitless, and Alex of his own
accord surrendered his pocket-knife.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now lie down.&#8221;
</p>
<p>With what grace he could, Alex complied. Making
a slip-loop in the center of the lariat, the cowman
passed it over one of the boy&#8217;s ankles, and made the
holding-knot as firm as he could draw it. Then passing
the two ends of the rope inside one of the lower
legs of the cot, he ran them across the room and secured
them to his own bed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;ll leave you comfortable, and put the knots
out of temptation,&#8221; he remarked. &#8220;Also, if you start
any wriggling this old shake-down of mine will act
as watch-dog. It squeaks if you look at it. And I&#8217;m
a powerful light snoozer, and powerful quick with the
gun when it&#8217;s necessary,&#8221; he added, with an emphasis
which Alex could not doubt.
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, when presently the cowman blew out
the light, and retired, Alex only waited until a steady,
deep snore announced that the man was asleep. Cautiously
he sat up, and reached toward his encircled
ankle.
</p>
<p>The knots had been secured cleverly and tightly.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_339' name='page_339'></a>339</span>
Pry and pull as he could, they gave no more than if
they had been made of wire.
</p>
<p>Working lower, Alex sought to reach the cot leg,
to see whether it was fixed to the floor. With some
difficulty, because of the sitting position made necessary,
he was straining toward it, when suddenly the
bound foot lunged from him, the rope tightened, and
from the cot opposite came a squeak. The snoring
instantly ceased, and Alex sat motionless, holding his
breath. The ominous silence continued, and finally he
lay back with a movement as though turning in his
sleep.
</p>
<p>Minute after minute passed, and still the breathing
of the man across the room did not resume.
</p>
<p>Then suddenly, it seemed, Alex found himself sitting
upright, and daylight flooding the room. He had
fallen asleep.
</p>
<p>The second cot was empty, but a moment after the
door opened and the cowman appeared.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How did you sleep, stranger?&#8221; he inquired. &#8220;I
thought for a spell last night you were trying some
funny business.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Alex laughed. &#8220;I slept like a log,&#8221; he declared
truthfully, ignoring the last remark. &#8220;Are you going
to keep me tied up here all day?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Until after breakfast anyway,&#8221; responded his host,
proceeding to start a fire in the stove. &#8220;Suppose
you&#8217;ll have some bacon and coffee?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, yes. I&#8217;m more than hollow, after
that Marathon run you gave me last night.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_340' name='page_340'></a>340</span></p>
<p>As the cowman turned to the cupboard Alex seized
the opportunity to examine the leg of the cot about
which the lassoo was passed. With disappointment
he discovered it to be a stout post driven into the
floor.
</p>
<p>Despite the discomfort of his position Alex enjoyed
the simple breakfast of biscuits and bacon. He was
passing his cup for a third filling of the fragrant coffee,
when his host abruptly sat the coffee-pot down and
listened. &#8220;Someone coming,&#8221; he remarked. Alex
also heard the hoofbeats. They approached rapidly,
there was a step at the door, and a tall, well-dressed
figure in riding-breeches and leggings appeared. At
sight of Alex he halted in surprise.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s this, Munson?&#8221; he demanded.
</p>
<p>The cowman led the way outside and closed the
door, and low words told Alex that he was explaining
the previous night&#8217;s occurrences. More, they told him
that this well-dressed man was the connecting link
between the K. &amp; Z. and the men who were seeking to
interfere with the Middle Western in the race for the
Yellow Creek Pass.
</p>
<p>What would be the outcome of the man&#8217;s visit for
him? Alex asked himself. For the newcomer would
not fail to appreciate the disadvantage of having been
seen there by the young employee of the M. W.
</p>
<p>The young operator was not left long in doubt. The
door again opened, and the stranger re-entered, followed
by the cowman, and without preliminary placed
a chair before Alex and dropped into it.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_341' name='page_341'></a>341</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Look here, my boy,&#8221; he began, &#8220;how would you
like to earn some extra money&mdash;a good decent
sum?&#8221;
</p>
<p>At once seeing the man&#8217;s intention, Alex bridled
indignantly. But suppressing his feelings, he responded,
&#8220;I&#8217;d like to as well as anyone else, I suppose&mdash;if
I can earn it honorably.&#8221;
</p>
<p>At the last word a flush mounted to the stranger&#8217;s
cheeks, but he continued. &#8220;Well, that&#8217;s all a matter
of opinion, you know. Every man has his own particular
code of honor. However&mdash;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You probably have guessed who I am?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A K. &amp; Z. man.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Now look here: Suppose the K. &amp; Z. was
anxious to know from day to day the precise progress
the Middle Western is making in this race for Yellow
Creek, and suppose they were willing to pay a hundred
dollars a month for the information&mdash;would that
proposition interest you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Alex replied promptly, &#8220;No, sir. And anyway,
it&#8217;s not the information you want. It&#8217;s my silence.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The man&#8217;s face darkened. He had one more card
to play, however.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, let it go at that, then. And suppose, in
addition to a hundred a month to keep silent as to
seeing me here, and what you have learned generally,
I should give you&mdash;&#8221; He thrust his hand into an
inside pocket and brought forth a long pocketbook.
&#8220;Suppose I should give you, say two hundred dollars,
cash?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_342' name='page_342'></a>342</span></p>
<p>Alex caught a knee between his hands and leaned
back against the wall.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not for sale,&#8221; he replied quietly.
</p>
<p>The would-be briber thrust the book back into his
pocket and sprang to his feet, purple with anger.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well, my young saint,&#8221; he sneered, &#8220;stay
where you are, then&mdash;till we&#8217;re good and ready to
let you go!&#8221;
</p>
<p>He strode to the door, Munson following him. &#8220;If
he tries to get away,&#8221; Alex heard him add as he
mounted his horse, &#8220;shoot him! I&#8217;ll protect you!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You <i>are</i> a young fool, all right,&#8221; Munson said,
returning. &#8220;You&#8217;ve simply made it worse for yourself.
You&#8217;ve sure now got to stay right here, indefinite.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And, as he ordered,&#8221; the cowman added determinedly,
&#8220;if you try to make a break-away of it, I&#8217;ll
sure shoot&mdash;and shoot to kill! When I go into a
thing, I put it through!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Alex, however, had no intention of staying, whatever
the risks, and when presently Munson, after
assuring himself that the knots were secure, passed
out, he immediately addressed himself to the task of
making his escape. It did not look difficult at first
sight, since both hands were free, and only one foot
tied. But an energetic attempt to loosen the cleverly-tied
slip-loop failed as completely as it had the night
before. Likewise, strain as he could at the cot leg,
he could not budge it, so firmly was it driven into the
hard ground.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_343' name='page_343'></a>343</span></p>
<p>With something like despair Alex at last relinquished
these endeavors, and turned to the problem of
cutting the rope in some way. In the hope of finding
a nail with which he might pick or fray the lariat
apart, he made a thorough examination of the cot.
There were nails, but they were driven in beyond hope
of drawing with his fingers.
</p>
<p>Dispiritedly Alex relinquished the search, and sat
up. His eyes wandered to the window near him.
Starting to his feet, he strained toward it.
</p>
<p>The lower corner of one of the panes had been
broken, and the triangle of glass leaned inward loosely.
With a low expression of hope Alex was reaching for
it, when from the rear of the cabin sounded the returning
footsteps of the cowman. Speedily Alex sank back
on the cot, and assumed an air of dejection.
</p>
<p>A few minutes later the boy again found himself
alone. But in the meantime he had decided to leave
the securing of the fragment of glass and the attempt
at escape until night. In further preparation for the
attempt Alex that afternoon stretched himself on the
cot, and slept several hours.
</p>
<p>To the young operator it seemed that the cowman
would never retire that night. And when at length
he blew out the light, and threw himself upon his bed,
he apparently lay an interminable time awake. At
length, however, when the moonlight in the window
pointed to approaching midnight, there came a faint
regular breathing, then a full long snore. Without
loss of time Alex got to his feet at the foot of the cot,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_344' name='page_344'></a>344</span>
and leaning against the wall, reached toward the window.
</p>
<p>He could just touch the broken corner of pane with
the tips of his fingers. Moving his supporting hand
farther along the wall, he drew back, and reached
forward with a lunge. This time he got his wrist on
the window-ledge. Thus leaning, he finally secured a
hold on the fragment of glass with his fingers, and
pulled on it. A crackle caused him to falter. Munson&#8217;s
breathing continued undisturbed. At the next
pull the piece came free. The next moment Alex was
sitting on the cot-end, sawing at the rope with the
sharp edge of the broken glass.
</p>
<p>To his disappointment, the edge, though sharp to
the feel, did not cut into the closely-woven and seasoned
twine as he had expected. Vigorously he sawed
away, however, and at last found that the extemporized
knife was taking hold.
</p>
<p>And finally, as the last gleam of moonlight died
from the window-panes, the remaining strand was
severed, and there was a faint slap as the rope fell to
the floor. A restless move by the sleeper and a momentary
cessation of the snoring gave Alex a thrill of fear.
Then the heavy breathing resumed, and getting to his
feet, he slipped to the door, found the catch, lifted it,
and passed out.
</p>
<p>As he closed the door, Alex paused a moment to
assure himself that the cowman was still breathing
regularly, and turned away jubilantly.
</p>
<p>Exultation over his escape was considerably tempered
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_345' name='page_345'></a>345</span>
when Alex discovered that the moon was almost
down in the west, and that in addition the sky overhead
was clouding. He set off immediately, however,
heading straight north, and when a safe distance had
been put between him and the cabin, broke into a run.
</p>
<p>At a steady jog Alex kept on for several miles over
the dimly-lit plain. Then the moon finally disappeared,
and he fell into a rapid walk. Some time later he
halted in alarm. Was he going in the right direction?
On every hand was a wall of darkness, and overhead
not a star was to be seen.
</p>
<p>He moved on, and again halted to debate the situation.
Certainly, for the time being, he was lost.
What should he do? Remain where he was till daylight?
or go ahead, and take the chance of circuiting
back? He decided to continue.
</p>
<p>Perhaps an hour later, still pushing ahead, Alex
strode full tilt into a barb-wire fence. As he staggered
back a second cry broke from him. Had he
circled back to Munson&#8217;s corral?
</p>
<p>His heart in his throat, he felt hurriedly along the
top wire to a post, and reached upward. A gasp of
relief greeted the discovery that the top of the post
was well within his reach. The corral posts were not
less than eight or nine feet, with wires to the top.
</p>
<p>A further cheering idea followed. On the ride to
the Antelope viaduct he had noted a three-wire fence
similar to this paralleling the right-of-way for several
miles. Perhaps this was the same fence?
</p>
<p>If he only knew its direction!
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_346' name='page_346'></a>346</span></p>
<p>Dropping to the ground for a brief rest, Alex set
his brains at recalling every bit of woods or plains
lore he had ever heard or read of for the telling of
direction.
</p>
<p>It was a puff of air against his cheek that suggested
the answer.
</p>
<p>The prevailing wind! What was it here?
</p>
<p>Southwest!
</p>
<p>In a moment he was on his knees at the foot of the
adjacent fence-post.
</p>
<p>On the farther side, half covering the dead grass,
was a small eddy of sand!
</p>
<p>Hopefully Alex hastened to the next post. <i>The
same!</i>
</p>
<p>To make doubly sure, he tried the third, and with
an exulting, &#8220;<i>The same again!</i>&#8221; started to his feet,
and struck on, whistling gaily, confident he was heading
due north, and that this was the same fence he
had seen along the new embankment.
</p>
<p>A further cheering thought occurred to the young
operator presently. The construction-train should
not be far from the stretch of road which paralleled
the fence!
</p>
<p>Onward he pushed through the darkness at a steady,
swinging gait, feeling frequently for the fence, to
make sure he was not wandering.
</p>
<p>For what seemed several hours Alex had been walking,
when a faint light appeared in the sky. It was
to his right. His plainsmanship had not put him
amiss.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_347' name='page_347'></a>347</span></p>
<p>As the light brightened he gazed anxiously ahead.
The ragged, thin-posted fence stretched unbroken to
the northern horizon. He had hoped the light would
reveal the swing to the east, and the dark shape of the
construction-train.
</p>
<p>Alex continued steadily ahead, however, buoying up
his lagging energies with pictures of a hot, appetizing
meal and a pleasant meeting with Jack and the rest
of his friends on the train. And finally, when the sun
had been some time above the horizon, he uttered a
shout. Far in front, but distinct in the beautifully clear
air, the fence turned abruptly to the east. And less
than a mile sun-ward was a long dark shape and columns
of smoke rising lazily into the air.
</p>
<p>Scrambling through the fence, Alex set off on a
bee-line for the train, whistling a brisk march.
</p>
<p>Five minutes later the whistler paused in the middle
of a note and spun sharply about. The color left his
bronzed face. A mile to the rear, on the other side
of the fence, a horseman was following him at full
speed. A glance at the white-faced pony told it was
Munson, and turning, Alex was off, running with
every ounce of his remaining energy.
</p>
<p>The thud of the hoofs gained rapidly.
</p>
<p>Closer they came, and Alex headed off farther from
the fence. Perhaps he&#8217;ll be afraid to put the horse
at the wire, he thought hopefully. He glanced back.
The cowman was wheeling off for the jump.
</p>
<p>In despair Alex looked over the long mile still separating
him from the train, and again over his shoulder.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_348' name='page_348'></a>348</span>
Would the horse make it? He slightly slowed his
steps as the animal made the rush.
</p>
<p>It went over like a bird.
</p>
<p>Gritting his teeth, Alex dashed straight back for the
fence. &#8220;I&#8217;ll make him jump his head off before he
gets me, anyway,&#8221; he said grimly. Flogging the pony,
the cowman endeavored to head the boy off, but Alex
reached the wire, and dove safely through. Scrambling
to his feet, he was on again, this time keeping
closer to the fence.
</p>
<p>It was as the pony drew up abreast fifty feet distant,
and while the train was still a good mile away, that
the idea of signalling for help on the fence-wire occurred
to Alex. He acted immediately. Catching up
a good-sized stone, he ran forward, and on the topmost
wire, near one of the posts, pounded with all his
might the telegraph dot letters &#8220;<i>Oh! Oh! Orr!
Orr!</i>&#8221;
</p>
<p>Munson had pulled up as Alex ran for the fence.
When the boy began pounding the wire he at once
recognized its purpose, and sprang from his horse,
drawing his pistol.
</p>
<p>Instantly Alex darted on, carrying the stone. The
cowman ran after. But the man was slow on his feet,
and despite his fatigue, Alex drew away from him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop, or I&#8217;ll shoot!&#8221; cried the cow-puncher.
&#8220;<i>Pull up! I will!</i>&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Go ahead, and they&#8217;ll hear you at the train!&#8221;
called Alex, though secretly trembling. The cowman
hesitated, then returned the revolver to its holster, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_349' name='page_349'></a>349</span>
ran back for his horse. Immediately Alex was again
at the wire, pounding out, &#8220;<i>Oh! Oh! Orr! Orr!</i>&#8221;
</p>
<p>The cowman was again up with him, and once more
he ran on, gazing anxiously toward the train for
signs of commotion to show his appeal had been heard.
</p>
<p>For some distance the strange race continued, the
cowman, angry and puzzled, on one side of the fence,
Alex keeping close to the wires on the other, in readiness
to dodge under should his pursuer jump.
</p>
<p>Finally the rider again swung off, and headed in
at a gallop. Grimly Alex halted. With a rush the
horse came directly toward him. Waiting until it was
within a few yards of him, he dropped to his knees,
and crawled half way through the fence.
</p>
<p>It was his undoing. Straight at him the horseman
came, as though to jump. Then suddenly the rider
whirled broadside, leaned from the saddle, and before
Alex, wildly scrambling, could withdraw, had him
firmly by the hair. By main force the cowboy dragged
his prisoner through the fence, and upright beside
him.
</p>
<p>With a half-stifled sob Alex lurched limply against
the pony&#8217;s shoulders. &#8220;Never mind, kid,&#8221; said the
cowman not unkindly. &#8220;You made a good fight of
it. You did your best. But I had to do my best too.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;ll give me your word to go quiet, I&#8217;ll let
you ride behind me,&#8221; he added. &#8220;Promise?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Alex cast a last look back toward the construction-train.
A few figures were moving about, slowly.
Clearly his signals had not been heard.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_350' name='page_350'></a>350</span></p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; he said wearily, and with some difficulty
mounting behind the cowboy, they were off the
weary way he had come.
</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Jack, at the construction-train, rose late that morning.
He had been up nearly all night, awaiting news
from the viaduct search-party, which throughout the
entire day had been scouring the nearby country for
his unaccountably missing chum. As he emerged from
the telegraph-car door he found the Indian, Little
Hawk, on the adjoining steps of the store-car.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good morning, Mr. Little Hawk,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Sunning
yourself?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wait for you. I hear noise&mdash;knock,&#8221; the Indian
said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Knock, like little tick-knock in car,&#8221; he added as
Jack regarded him, mystified.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tick-knock? What do you mean?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;On fence,&#8221; said the Indian stolidly. &#8220;Hearum
twice. Like dis:&#8221; And while Jack&#8217;s eyes opened
wide, with a stone he held in his hand the Indian
tapped on the iron hand-rail of the car the telegraph
words, &#8220;Oh&mdash;Oh&mdash;Orr.&#8221;
</p>
<p>In a moment Jack was on the ground before him,
all excitement. &#8220;Where? Where did you hear it?&#8221;
he cried.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Fence. Sleep dar,&#8221; said the Indian, pointing to
the nearby fence. &#8220;No t&#8217;ink much about. Den see
horse run&mdash;way dar. Den t&#8217;ink tick-knock, an&#8217; come
you.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_351' name='page_351'></a>351</span></p>
<p>Uttering a shrill shout Jack was off on the jump
to find Superintendent Finnan. And fifteen minutes
later the superintendent, Little Hawk, and one of the
foremen, mounted, were away on the gallop along the
ranch fence toward the point at which the Indian had
seen the disappearing horseman.
</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Alex was thoroughly exhausted when he found himself
once more at the ranch. Slipping to the ground,
he entered the cabin of his own accord, and threw
himself dejectedly upon the couch.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve near spoiled a dinged fine rope,&#8221; observed
Munson, following him, and kicking at the lariat, still
stretched across the floor. &#8220;Oh, well, I can take it
out of the K. &amp; Z.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now for some breakfast. Suppose you don&#8217;t feel
too bad to grub, eh? Though you sure don&#8217;t deserve
none.&#8221;
</p>
<p>As on the previous morning, Alex and his jailer
were near the conclusion of the meal when hoofbeats
again told of the approach of a visitor. Going to the
door, the cowman announced &#8220;Bennet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So that&#8217;s his name, is it?&#8221; said Alex quickly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What? Did I say&mdash;Well, let it go. I don&#8217;t see
that it makes much difference. Yes, Bennet&#8217;s his
name.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And mighty lucky thing I have you back here,&#8221;
he added over his shoulder.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good morning, Mr. Bennet,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Caught
us at breakfast again.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_352' name='page_352'></a>352</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Breakfast! What are you doing at breakfast this
time of day?&#8221; inquired the K. &amp; Z. man, entering.
When the cowman explained, the newcomer glowered
at Alex threateningly. &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you shoot?&#8221;
he demanded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Too near the train. They would have heard it,&#8221;
responded Munson.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, clear off the table. I have something I
want to show you,&#8221; said Bennet, producing what
looked like a map from his pocket.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And you get off to a corner,&#8221; he snarled at Alex.
&#8220;Why isn&#8217;t he tied up?&#8221; he demanded of the cowboy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He agreed to a twenty-four hours&#8217; truce&mdash;not to
make another break in that time,&#8221; the cowman answered
as he swept their few dishes into the cupboard.
</p>
<p>Bennet&#8217;s lip curled under his moustache. &#8220;And you
believe him, eh?&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was a suggestion of tartness in the cowman&#8217;s
prompt &#8220;Sure! He rode behind me all the way back,
on his word not to attempt anything, and kept it.
Could have pulled my own gun on me if he&#8217;d wanted
to.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The more fool,&#8221; muttered the railroad man as he
spread the roll of paper on the table.
</p>
<p>Alex meantime had stepped to the window from
which he had taken the fragment of glass, and was
disconsolately watching a half dozen hens scratching
about below.
</p>
<p>Lifting his eyes, he glanced out over the plain. The
men at the table heard a sharply-indrawn breath. It
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_353' name='page_353'></a>353</span>
was immediately changed into a low whistling, however,
and they gave their attention again to the map.
</p>
<p>Alex had discovered three horsemen heading for the
ranch from the north. And the leading pony he would
have known in a hundred. It was Little Hawk&#8217;s
heavily-mottled horse.
</p>
<p>That they were coming to his assistance&mdash;that
someone had heard the knocking on the wire&mdash;he had
not a doubt.
</p>
<p>The horsemen were still some distance out of hearing.
Ceasing the whistling, Alex glanced casually
toward the table. Seated in chairs, the two men were
still deeply engrossed in the plan before them, talking
in low voices.
</p>
<p>When on turning back to the window Alex recognized
the second horseman as Superintendent Finnan,
he shot a further glance toward the K. &amp; Z. man at
the table, and a smile of anticipation and delight overspread
his face.
</p>
<p>Then suddenly it occurred to him that in a few minutes
the hoofbeats of the on-coming horses would be
heard, and that Bennet would have time to get to the
door and escape.
</p>
<p>He must halt his rescuers, and signal them to approach
on foot!
</p>
<p>A moment Alex thought, then casually remarking
to the cowman, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to open the window. It&#8217;s
hot,&#8221; unlatched and swung the sash inward. The
move passed unnoticed, and leaning out he pretended
to call the chickens.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_354' name='page_354'></a>354</span></p>
<p>What he was in reality doing was energetically
waving his handkerchief backwards and forwards below,
making the railroad &#8220;stop&#8221; signal.
</p>
<p>The horsemen came on. If they came much farther
they would be heard!
</p>
<p>He paused, and waved again, more energetically.
The third horseman pulled up. Quickly Alex followed
with the signal to &#8220;come ahead with caution.&#8221; The
rear pony spurred forward, pulled up beside the second,
and apparently at a call, the Indian also halted.
On Alex repeating the last signal, all dismounted, and
he knew he had been understood.
</p>
<p>Leaving their horses where they were, the three men
came on at a quick walk. Alex, continuing to talk to
the hens, could scarcely contain his secret delight.
</p>
<p>When his rescuers were within a hundred yards of
the cabin, he once more signalled caution, and they
continued stealthily, revolvers in hand.
</p>
<p>They reached the corner of the house, unheard by
the men at the table. The superintendent raised his
eyebrows questioningly. Alex glanced over his shoulder,
and nodded sharply. The next moment there was
a rush of feet without, and all in a twinkle Bennet
and the cowman were out of their chairs, at the door,
and staggering back before three threatening revolvers.
Staring open-mouthed, they brought up beside
the overturned table.
</p>
<p>Alex&#8217;s words were the first. &#8220;These were the chickens
I was calling, Mr. Bennet,&#8221; he remarked gleefully.
The K. &amp; Z. man recovered himself and turned on
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_355' name='page_355'></a>355</span>
the boy, white with passion. He was stopped by an
exclamation from Finnan. &#8220;Bennet! George Bennet!
What are you doing here?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps this will explain, sir,&#8221; said Alex, handing
over the map, which he had caught up during the
excitement. Bennet made a frantic move to intercept
him, but promptly Little Hawk&#8217;s revolver was in
his face, and he sank back into a chair, gritting his
teeth.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A plan showing every bridge and culvert on our
line, and directions for blowing them all up, simultaneously!
Well&mdash;&#8221; Words failed the superintendent.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And this is what you have come to, Bennet? I&#8217;d
never have believed it!&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was a second awkward silence, when Superintendent
Finnan suddenly broke it with, &#8220;Look here.
I&#8217;ve got you now, haven&#8217;t I? I&#8217;ve got you where I
can put you in jail for a year or so at least. Well,
instead of doing that, I&#8217;ll make you a proposition:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Drop all this kind of work; guarantee that there
will be no more of it&mdash;agree to make it a straight,
square building race between your road and mine, the
first one to reach the Pass to win&mdash;guarantee that,
and I&#8217;ll let you go.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you agree?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Bennet rose to his feet and held out his hand. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
give you my solemn word, Finnan.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And&mdash;and I&#8217;m awfully sorry I ever consented to
go into this kind of thing,&#8221; the K. &amp; Z. man went on,
a quaver in his voice. &#8220;But it was put up to me, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_356' name='page_356'></a>356</span>
when I&#8217;d taken the first step, I thought I&#8217;d have to
carry it through.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He turned to Alex. &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry for the way you
have been treated, my lad. You are a plucky boy, and
straight. You keep on as you have, and you&#8217;ll never
find yourself in the position I am.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I offered him two hundred dollars cash and a hundred
a month to keep his mouth quiet,&#8221; the speaker
explained to the superintendent, &#8220;and he refused it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How about the Antelope viaduct, Mr. Finnan?&#8221;
Alex asked as they rode away, he on one of Munson&#8217;s
loaned ponies. &#8220;It wasn&#8217;t blown up?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, but an attempt of some kind was made.
Rather a mysterious affair,&#8221; the superintendent said.
&#8220;Late last night an Italian of the fill gang was seen
stealing to one of the main foundations, then kicking
and tearing something to pieces. Norton followed
him, and found some fuses, and fragments of paper
that had been wrapped about some strange kind of
explosive, which apparently had failed to ignite. The
Italian has not been seen since.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Alex was chuckling. &#8220;I think I can guess why
that &#8216;strange explosive&#8217; failed to go off, sir,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;It was clay.&#8221; And continuing, he explained the mystery
in detail. Superintendent Finnan laughed heartily.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Ward, you are certainly due a vote of
thanks,&#8221; he declared seriously. &#8220;You saved the viaduct,
and now you probably have brought about the
ending of the entire trouble with the K. &amp; Z. people.
I&#8217;ll not fail to turn in a thorough report of it.&#8221;

<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_357' name='page_357'></a>357</span>
<h2>XXII</h2>
<h3>THE DEFENSE OF THE VIADUCT</h3>
</div>

<p>Thanks to the termination of the interference
from the opposition road, the work on the extension
progressed rapidly, and two weeks later found the
rail-head seven miles beyond the Antelope viaduct, in
the lower slopes of the Dog Rib Mountains. The coveted
pass to the Yellow Creek gold-field lay but eight
miles distant, and as the K. &amp; Z. was still twenty miles
east, it appeared certain that the Middle Western
would win the great race.
</p>
<p>The time had passed uneventfully with the three
young telegraphers, the end of the second week finding
Alex and Jack together with the construction-train at
the rail-head, and Wilson Jennings back at the temporary
station and material-sidings at the viaduct.
</p>
<p>Perhaps the last few days had passed least interestingly
with Wilson, alone in his little box-car station,
not far from the old river-bed. Saturday had seemed
particularly slow, for some reason, and shortly after
8 o&#8217;clock Wilson threw aside a book he had been reading,
and catching up his hat, made for the door, for
a brief stroll, previous to retiring.
</p>
<p>The moon was momentarily showing through a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_358' name='page_358'></a>358</span>
break in the cloudy sky, and looking to the west, Wilson
was somewhat surprised to discover the figures
of two men approaching. When as he watched they
reached the first of a train of tie-cars, and leaving the
rails, continued forward in the shadows, Wilson
stepped back, in disquiet.
</p>
<p>The strangers came opposite, and paused, looking
toward the station window and speaking in subdued
voices. Convinced that something was afoot, the
young operator turned quickly, and stooping low, that
his shadow might not be seen on the window, crept to
the little instrument table and reached for the telegraph
key. He opened, and pressed it down. The
sounder did not respond. He tried again, adjusting
the relay, and turned about in genuine alarm.
</p>
<p>The wire had been cut! Some mischief was surely
afoot.
</p>
<p>From without came the crunch of stealthy footsteps.
Springing to his bunk, Wilson secured his revolver
and belt&mdash;the same taken from the would-be bullion
thief he had captured at Bonepile&mdash;and stealing to
the rear door, slipped out and to the ground just as
the strangers approached the opposite side of the little
car-depot.
</p>
<p>The car was raised on a foundation of ties, and as
the two men entered, Wilson crept beneath.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No one here,&#8221; said a gruff voice. &#8220;Say, do you
s&#8217;pose he saw us, and sneaked?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Like as not. I told you to keep to the rails and
come straight up,&#8221; chided the other.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_359' name='page_359'></a>359</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps he will come back. We&#8217;re in charge of
the station anyway. That was the real thing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wilson waited to hear no more. Creeping forth,
he stole off toward the ravine, intending to get out of
sight in its shadows.
</p>
<p>A short distance from the head of the viaduct was
the green light of a small target-switch. The head
of the downward path lay just beyond, and Wilson
headed for the light. He reached it, and passed on.
</p>
<p>Abruptly he halted and turned about. Like an inspiration
had come the remembrance of Alex Ward&#8217;s
signalling feat two years before at Bixton, of which
he had heard from Jack Orr. Could he not do the
same? Try and signal Alex or Jack, at the construction-train?
Say, from one of the box-cars at the
farther corner of the yard?
</p>
<p>Casting a glance toward the little station to assure
himself that all was quiet there, Wilson retraced his
steps to the switch, removed the lantern, and tucking
it under his coat, was off between the material-cars
for the farthermost corner of the sidings.
</p>
<p>The outermost car was a box-car. Climbing the
ladder, with his handkerchief Wilson tied the lantern
to the topmost rung, the red light out, and using his
hat just as Alex had done, began flashing the call of
the construction-train,
</p>
<p>&#8220;KX, KX, V! KX, KX, V!&#8221;
</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Since the construction-train had started from Yellow
Creek Junction it had been a center of attraction to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_360' name='page_360'></a>360</span>
coyotes for fifty miles around, and one of the few recreations
enjoyed by the men of the train had been
hunting them at night.
</p>
<p>This Saturday night Alex and Jack, borrowing
Winchesters from other members of the telegraph-car
party, had set out for a &#8220;couple of good rugs,&#8221; as
they put it, and on leaving the train had headed east,
toward the aqueduct, in which direction they had
heard barks of the midnight prowlers.
</p>
<p>They had gone perhaps three miles, and had fired
on several of the wily animals, without success, when
suddenly Jack caught Alex by the arm and pointed
away to the east.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Look, Al! What&#8217;s that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, it looks like&mdash;It is! It&#8217;s a signal
light!
</p>
<p>&#8220;And calling us&mdash;KX!&#8221; cried Alex. &#8220;Something
must be wrong with Wilson!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;ll we do? Back to the train?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you a match and some paper?&#8221; said Alex,
going hurriedly through his own pockets.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Some matches.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s a couple of letters. Come on back to
the rails, find some chips, and make a fire. See
if we can&#8217;t answer him, and learn what the trouble
is.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They were already racing for the track, reached it,
and quickly gathering together a little pile of dry bark
and chips knocked from the ties, made a fire at the
track-side, and lit it.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_361' name='page_361'></a>361</span></p>
<p>As the flames burst up Alex threw off his coat, and
using it as a curtain, raised and lowered it in a flashed
&#8220;I, I, KX!&#8221;
</p>
<p>The call twinkled on. Wilson had not seen it. But
the next moment, before Alex had completed a second
answer, the red light disappeared. Alex again shot
forth the gleaming &#8220;I, I, KX!&#8221; and in blinking response
they read:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Chased out of station. Two men. Wire cut.
Something wrong. Help!&mdash;V.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;OK. But we are three miles from the train.
Hunting. Will we come, or go back for help?&#8221; signalled
Alex.
</p>
<p>There was a pause, and the red light blinked,
&#8220;Come! Quick!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;OK. Coming.&#8221; Only pausing to stamp out the
fire, the two boys were away at a run, heading directly
for the light, which at intervals Wilson continued to
show, as a guide.
</p>
<p>Their open-air experience of a month had put the
two boys in the best of condition, and keeping on at
a smart pace, within half an hour the light showed just
ahead, and a few minutes after Wilson ran forward
to greet them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s in the air, but certainly
something,&#8221; he announced. &#8220;As you fellows are
armed too, suppose we go back and get the two men
in the station car, and see if we can&#8217;t make them tell?&#8221;
he suggested.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lead ahead,&#8221; agreed the others.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_362' name='page_362'></a>362</span></p>
<p>Stealthily they made their way amid the intervening
cars, and emerged opposite the little depot.
</p>
<p>In the window was the shadow of a man smoking.
</p>
<p>They stole across to the door, and Wilson, leading,
cautiously glanced within. He turned and held up one
finger. Revolver in hand, he tiptoed up the steps, and
with a cry sprang inside and toward the man in the
chair. The intruder was so taken by surprise that he
tumbled over backward. In a jiffy the three boys
were upon him, and had pinned him to the floor; and
while Alex closely clutched his mouth, to prevent him
calling out, the others speedily bound his hands and
feet with some convenient pieces of wire.
</p>
<p>Satisfied that their prisoner was firmly secured, and
having removed his pistol and cartridge-belt, the boys
replaced him in the chair, and Wilson, pointing his
revolver at the man&#8217;s head, demanded, &#8220;Where is
your pard? And what are you and he up to?&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was a look of amusement in the man&#8217;s face
as Alex removed his hand, and he replied, &#8220;Nothin&#8217;
doin&#8217;, boys. You&#8217;ll have to guess.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll give you three, to tell,&#8221; said Wilson, assuming
a fierce expression and beginning to count.
</p>
<p>The prisoner laughed outright. &#8220;You gentleman
kids wouldn&#8217;t shoot a fly,&#8221; he declared coolly.
</p>
<p>Wilson colored with mortification. For of course
he had had no intention of shooting. Even Alex and
Jack were forced to smile at the turn of the situation.
Wilson had his revenge, however. &#8220;Gag him, then,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_363' name='page_363'></a>363</span>
Al,&#8221; he suggested, &#8220;and we will stow him away beneath
the car.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The man&#8217;s mouth opened for a shout. In a flash
Alex had slapped a handkerchief between his teeth,
and despite the man&#8217;s struggles stuffed it well in.
Then, taking from his neck a long colored neckerchief,
he bound it twice about the man&#8217;s face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now out with him, this side,&#8221; said Wilson, opening
the rear door.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t it be better to take him over under one
of the cars on the sidings?&#8221; Jack suggested. &#8220;His
pard might return, and he kick, or make some kind
of a noise underneath.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so.&#8221; Dragging their prisoner forth, they
glanced up and down to see that no one was in sight,
and with Jack at his feet and Alex and Wilson at his
arms, they hastened across the rails, passed between
two freight-cars, and in the deep shadow beyond placed
him on the ground and bound him firmly to a rail.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Be sure you don&#8217;t talk now,&#8221; said Wilson derisively
as they turned away.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What next?&#8221; Jack asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s pretty sure to be some mischief about the
bridge. Let&#8217;s have a look around there,&#8221; suggested
Alex.
</p>
<p>Approaching the brink of the ravine at a point some
distance from the viaduct, the boys glanced below.
From the three broke a simultaneous low cry of understanding
and indignation.
</p>
<p>In the light of several lanterns a party of seemingly
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_364' name='page_364'></a>364</span>
fifteen or twenty men were piling brush about the
base of one of the central wooden piers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The K. &amp; Z. people again, sure as you&#8217;re born!&#8221;
exclaimed Alex hotly. &#8220;And after their solemn agreement!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If they succeed in burning it, they will hold back
our supplies two or three weeks, and reach the pass
ahead of us, dead certain,&#8221; added Jack through his
teeth. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got to stop them, boys!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t there a hand-car or a velocipede here,
Wilse?&#8221; Alex inquired.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No. Not even a push-car. And it&#8217;d take one
of us an hour and a half to reach the construction-train.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But that&#8217;s certainly the only thing to be done,&#8221;
Jack pointed out. &#8220;Perhaps two of us, with the rifles,
could hold them&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>A flicker of light broke out below which was not
a lantern, and approached the dimly disclosed brush-pile.
Quick as a flash Jack&#8217;s rifle went to his shoulder,
and there was a reverberating crash. The light disappeared
and there came up a chorus of surprised
shouts and the clatter of running feet.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now we are in for it. I think we had better stick
it out together,&#8221; said Alex quietly. &#8220;Perhaps the
firing will be heard at the train.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The others agreed, and at Wilson&#8217;s suggestion they
made their way a few feet down the slope to a ledge
from which the whole structure of the bridge could
dimly be seen.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_365' name='page_365'></a>365</span></p>
<p>&#8220;How are you fellows off for ammunition?&#8221; whispered
Wilson.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have four more rounds in the rifle, and thirty
in my belt,&#8221; said Jack.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Five in the gun and twenty-seven in the belt,&#8221;
Alex announced.
</p>
<p>Wilson had been examining the revolver and belt
they had taken from the prisoner, and which he had
brought with him. &#8220;Fourteen in the two pistols and
nearly sixty in the two belts,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We ought to be able to put up all kinds of a
fight,&#8221; Alex declared confidently. &#8220;That is, unless
they&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>He broke off, and all leaned forward, peering down
into the gloom, and listening. From a little to the
left rose the clatter of a pebble. Wilson stretched
himself on his face, and bent over, one of his pistols
extended. Barely breathing, they waited, and again
came a faint clatter as of loosened earth, nearer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let him get too close,&#8221; Alex whispered.
</p>
<p>There came the sound of something snapping, a
smothered exclamation, and instantly Wilson fired.
There was a shrill cry, and the crash of something rolling
downward. At the same moment from below
came a crashing volley of shots, and bullets snarled
upward by them like a swarm of bees. The boys
shrank back flat, then leaned over and returned two
quick volleys.
</p>
<p>Another cry indicated that one of their bullets had
found a mark, and following a scattering return volley
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_366' name='page_366'></a>366</span>
from the darkness there were sounds of a hurried
scuttling for cover.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyone touched?&#8221; Jack asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I lost a little hair,&#8221; said Wilson quietly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Me too,&#8221; said Alex. &#8220;But a miss is as good as
a mile, you know. And we have the advantage so
far.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sh!&#8221; warned Jack. In the silence came the sound
of running footsteps farther up the gully, followed by
a continuous rattle of falling stones.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re making a rush up another path. Quick,
and stop them!&#8221; exclaimed Wilson, starting to his
feet.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold on,&#8221; Alex interrupted as they reached the
crest of the slope. &#8220;Perhaps it&#8217;s a ruse to get us
away, so they can start the fire. You two run and
chase them down, and I&#8217;ll stay and watch here. If
you need help, shout.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wilson and Jack sprang away along the brink of
the ravine. A hundred yards distant the sounds of
men ascending rose from directly beneath them.
Without pause they fired. Cries of rage followed, and
as the boys dropped to the ground a dozen bullets
whined over them. Promptly Wilson replied with the
entire seven shots from one of his pistols, there was
a crash as of someone falling, then a general scrambling
as the entire party apparently tumbled precipitately
down the steep slope. Rising to their feet, the
boys fired several more shots, and hastened back
toward Alex.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_367' name='page_367'></a>367</span></p>
<p>As they neared him the crash of his rifle told he had
guessed rightly that another attempt would be made
to light the fire.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Quick!&#8221; he said, slamming the loading mechanism.
&#8220;They&#8217;re sticking to it!&#8221;
</p>
<p>Wilson and Jack saw several twinkling flames, and
the roar of Alex&#8217;s next shot was followed by the crash
of their own weapons. A cry of agony followed, and
one of the lights disappeared. Another faltered, and
also went out.
</p>
<p>Alex once more brought up his rifle, took careful
aim; the jet of flame leaped from the muzzle, and with
a shout the boys saw the last spot of light describe an
arc in the air, and go out.
</p>
<p>An angry howl followed, then a continuous volley
from several different points. The spirit of fight had
taken full possession of the three lads on the brink of
the ravine, however, and lying close, they gave back
shot for shot, quickly but steadily. Finally a lull came,
and Alex rose exultingly on an elbow and shouted
below, &#8220;Come on, you cowards! Come&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>From behind one of the bridge pillars leaped a flame,
and with a sharp intake of breath Alex slipped sideways.
But as Wilson and Jack sprang to his side he
again rose. &#8220;It&#8217;s nothing,&#8221; he declared. &#8220;Just a
graze inside the arm.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The quiet continuing, the others insisted on removing
Alex&#8217;s coat, and feeling, found the shirt-sleeve
wet. &#8220;Tie a handkerchief round it,&#8221; Alex directed.
&#8220;There. That&#8217;s all right.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_368' name='page_368'></a>368</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I get for allowing myself to be carried
away, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; he added as Wilson and Jack
helped him into his coat. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t realize how&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>All three snatched up their weapons and spun about.
</p>
<p>A tall stooped figure was standing within a few feet
of them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Surrender!&#8221; cried Wilson. &#8220;<i>Quick, or I&#8217;ll&mdash;</i>&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It me, Little Hawk,&#8221; said a quiet voice. &#8220;Why
shoot?&#8221;
</p>
<p>With a common cry of joy the boys sprang forward,
and quickly explained the situation. The Indian
grunted. &#8220;Not K. &amp; Z. man,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Bad cowboy,
miner, gambler, from Yellow Creek. Makeum
big bet K. &amp; Z. win, come burn bridge, makeum win.
Little Hawk hearum talk, come follow, hearum fight,
come quick.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thinkum big fight. Only three boy fight, eh?&#8221;
he added in surprise.
</p>
<p>Alex had been considering. &#8220;Look here, Little
Hawk,&#8221; he suggested, &#8220;you ride back to the construction-train
and give the alarm, will you? I think we
have these fellows scared now, and can hold them till
help comes. And none of us could ride that pony of
yours.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I findum nother hoss&mdash;cowboy hoss,&#8221; said the
Indian, pointing the way he had come. &#8220;You go,
takeum, Little Hawk stay fight.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Alex thought a minute. &#8220;No; I&#8217;d rather stick,
and see the thing through, now,&#8221; he declared.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Me too,&#8221; said Jack promptly.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_369' name='page_369'></a>369</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Same here,&#8221; Wilson agreed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s up to you, then, Little Hawk.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, hold on!&#8221; Alex interrupted as the Indian
turned away. &#8220;Boys, how about Little Hawk taking
our prisoner back with him on the other horse? The
folks at the train might get some information out of
him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Could you take him, Little Hawk?&#8221; he asked.
</p>
<p>The redskin grunted assent. &#8220;Tieum to saddle,&#8221;
he said.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go and show him where the rascal is,&#8221; volunteered
Wilson.
</p>
<p>A few minutes later, with the boys&#8217; prisoner trailing
behind, securely bound to the saddle of the wandering
horse he had picked up, the Indian was off across
the plain to the west at the top of his mottled pony&#8217;s
speed.
</p>
<p>When Wilson returned to Alex and Jack he found
them busy constructing a miniature block-house of ties
they had thrown from a neighboring car. &#8220;That&#8217;s
the idea,&#8221; he said, joining them. &#8220;We could hold
out in that all night, easily.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No; leave that opening, Wilse,&#8221; Jack interposed
as Wilson began closing a gap at one of the corners.
&#8220;That&#8217;s to command the bridge. We&#8217;re going to
fire through, not over.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The boys had just completed their little fort when
from the top of the gully immediately opposite came
a spit of flame, followed by the plaintive hum of a
pistol bullet above them. Promptly they dropped below
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_370' name='page_370'></a>370</span>
the ties, and Alex, who had that side, aimed
toward the spot at which he had seen the flash, and
as it spat out again, crashed back with his Winchester.
From several points along the opposite level a ragged
fire followed, and continued intermittently.
</p>
<p>Then finally, as the boys had half expected, there
came a smattering volley from amid the cars on the
sidings behind them. The body of their assailants had
reached the surface on their side.
</p>
<p>Now it was that the three began to experience their
first real anxiety. For despite their show of confidence
to one another, each secretly knew that if a determined
rush was made from near at hand, there was scarcely
an even chance of their standing it off.
</p>
<p>As a provision against this eventuality Wilson did
very little firing during the almost steady exchange of
shots that followed, keeping the chambers of his two
revolvers always full. To the same end, Alex and
Jack used their magazine-rifles as single-shots, holding
the magazines, fully charged, in reserve.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I&#8217;m getting one of them now and then,&#8221;
Alex was saying about half an hour after the disappearance
of the Indian. &#8220;Or else&mdash;&#8221; He broke off
to fire again. &#8220;Unless their ammunition is giving out
over there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Suddenly Jack snapped open his magazine. &#8220;Here
they come!&#8221; he whispered. Alex scrambled about
beside him. Wilson thrust the pistol-barrels through
the loop-hole.

</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum'><a id='page_373' name='page_373'></a>373</span></div>
<p>From the dark line of the cars rose a shouted command,
there came a ripping volley of a dozen Colts,
and a dim group of figures rushed toward them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, steady!&#8221; warned Alex. &#8220;And shoot low!
</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Fire!</i>&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Crash!</i>&#8221; went the Winchesters, &#8220;<i>Crack, crack,
crack!</i>&#8221; the pistols.
</p>
<p>Two of the leading runners went to their hands and
knees. The others rushed on, shouting and spitting
flames.
</p>
<p>Keeping well under cover, the boys fired as quickly
as they could work their weapons. Wilson felt a
stinging snip at his right ear, and a warm stream trickling
down his neck. He emptied the first pistol, and
began with the second.
</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Crash! Crash!</i>&#8221; roared the Winchesters.
</p>
<p>The attackers held on. They had made half the distance.
In spite of themselves, the boys began firing
nervously.
</p>
<p>Closer the running figures came.
</p>
<p>Jack snapped back his reloading mechanism, and
pulled the trigger. There was no report.
</p>
<p>His cry of consternation was echoed by Alex.
</p>
<p>They had fired their last shots!
</p>
<p>With a wild shout of triumph two of their assailants
were upon them.
</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>From a clear patch of sky bright moonlight flooded
the construction-train and the gray slope of the hill
to the southeast about which the rails had crept that
day. Grouped on the rear steps of the store-car,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_374' name='page_374'></a>374</span>
Superintendent Finnan and several of his foremen
sat and smoked, and listened.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; it&#8217;s a horse,&#8221; said one of the foremen.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Two horses,&#8221; declared the superintendent. &#8220;And
coming as though Old Nick were after them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Over the moonlit rise swept a figure on horseback,
then another.
</p>
<p>On discovering the group at the car, the leader uttered
a shrill whoop, and tore down the slope toward
them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The first is Little Hawk! The other is a prisoner!
What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221; cried the superintendent, springing
to the ground.
</p>
<p>The Indian pulled up in a cloud of dust before him,
and threw himself from his reeking pony.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Want burnum bridge,&#8221; he said, indicating his
prisoner. &#8220;Five, ten, more! Much more! Three
boy&mdash;tick-knock boy&mdash;fightem!
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hear? Hear?&#8221;
</p>
<p>He placed his hand to his ear.
</p>
<p>The incredulous group turned to the east and listened.
</p>
<p>As from infinitely far away, half heard, half felt,
came a low, deadened &#8220;Plugk!... Plugk, plugk!...
Plugk!&#8221;
</p>
<p>A moment the startled railroadmen stared at one
another. Then quickly the superintendent spoke.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ryan, rout out the engineer and firemen! The
rest of you run for your guns, and a dozen good men
from your gangs! Don&#8217;t lose a minute!&#8221;
</p>
<div class='figcenter'>

THE INDIAN PULLED UP IN A CLOUD OF DUST.
<br />
</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum'><a id='page_377' name='page_377'></a>377</span></div>
<p>The group scattered with a rush. Fifteen minutes
later, with men filling her cab and clustered on the
tender, the engine was under way, rushing eastward.
</p>
<p>As rapidly the speed was increased, the locomotive
rocked and leaped over the new roadbed, but with the
superintendent at his elbow, the engineer drove her
up to the last notch, and the prairie streamed by them
like a blanket.
</p>
<p>Half the distance was made, and above the noise
of the engine came a sharp &#8220;Tap, tap! Tap, tap,
tap!&#8221;
</p>
<p>On the engine rushed, and the distant shapes of
cars appeared. Simultaneously there came a crashing
volley of shots, and a chorus of shouting. The men
on the engine gripped their guns, and stared ahead
into the space lit up by the headlight.
</p>
<p>With reducing speed they struck a curve, and the
stream of light swung about toward the bridge. The
next moment into the glare broke a group of madly
struggling figures.
</p>
<p>On the flash of the light the fighting ceased. There
were cries of alarm, and the renegades began to break
and flee. A small party stood, and fired toward the
engine. But with a roar the railroadmen leaped and
tumbled to the ground, and rushed at them, and they
too broke and fled.
</p>
<p>And the great fight was over, and won.
</p>
<p>The superintendent was first to reach the little barricade.
Jack, he found unconscious from a blow on
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_378' name='page_378'></a>378</span>
the head. Wilson had fainted, and Alex drooped
limply on the wall of ties, exhausted past speaking.
The faces, hands and clothes of all bore mute witness
to the desperate struggle they had put up during those
last terrible minutes.
</p>
<p>Within a short time, however, all three boys had
somewhat recovered, and were able to take their places
in the engine cab; and a half hour later the party
headed back for the construction-train, coupled behind
them a box-car containing eighteen prisoners. Ten
of the captured men were found to have been wounded,
several seriously; but to the relief of the boys none
had been killed outright.
</p>
<p>When rescued, rescuers and prisoners arrived at the
construction-train they found an excited crowd of
over three hundred men awaiting them. And on the
details of the affair quickly spreading, the three boys
were literally swept from their feet by the enthusiastic
foreigners, hoisted into the air, and carried to the
telegraph-car to a continuous roar of &#8220;hurrahs&#8221; and
&#8220;bravos.&#8221;
</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>The following Wednesday a special train, to which
was attached Division Superintendent Cameron&#8217;s private
car, drew up at the rear of the boarding-train.
Proceeding thither in response to a message, Alex and
Jack found Wilson, who had been picked up at the
viaduct station, Construction Superintendent Finnan
and several other Middle Western officials.
</p>
<p>Having greeted them warmly, the division superintendent
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_379' name='page_379'></a>379</span>
took a small package from his desk, and
opened it. &#8220;I know you don&#8217;t like speeches, boys,&#8221;
he began; &#8220;and in any case, I&#8217;m not sure I could do
justice to the occasion. But, here! These three
gold watches&mdash;the very finest the company&#8217;s money
could buy, I may say&mdash;will show you what we think
of the loyalty to the company, and the splendid courage
you three lads displayed last Saturday night in
defense of the Antelope viaduct.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I might just read one of the inscriptions,&#8221; he said,
opening Alex&#8217;s watch.
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;To Alex Ward, from the Middle Western Railroad,
in recognition of the heroic part he played in the
defense of the Antelope viaduct, November 2nd, 18&mdash;,
and in thus ensuring the victory of the Middle Western
in its memorable race with the K. &amp; Z. for the
Yellow Creek Pass.&#8217;
</p>
<p>&#8220;For that is precisely what it meant,&#8221; declared the
superintendent. &#8220;The pass is ours now, beyond any
chance.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And finally,&#8221; he concluded, as Alex, Jack and
Wilson, scarcely knowing what to say, took the three
beautiful watches, &#8220;I would just like to remark that
if you three boys do not some day stand where I stand,
or higher, I&#8217;ll be both greatly surprised and disappointed.&#8221;
</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>That this prediction was justified, you can to-day
learn from any directory of railroad officials&mdash;for
there, in the pages devoted to the Middle Western,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_380' name='page_380'></a>380</span>
you will find the name of Alexander Ward, Superintendent,
Western Division; John Orr, Superintendent,
Central Division; and, as General Superintendent of
Telegraphs, Wilson A. Jennings.
